It is shown that in macroscopic systems all eigenmodes are generally harmonic. Strong anharmonicity is found for the bare localized modes in the low-frequency region around the boson peak. This anharmonicity is related to the rotational motion of coupled SiO4 tetrahedra and differs in character from the anharmonicity of the high-frequency localized eigenmodes which are mainly related to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of SiO4 tetrahedra.},

@article{Wilkins2018,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Li2015a,
abstract = {Understanding elementary excitations and their couplings in condensed matter systems is critical for developing better energy-conversion devices. In thermoelectric materials, the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency is directly improved by suppressing the propagation of phonon quasiparticles responsible for macroscopic thermal transport. The current record material for thermoelectric conversion efficiency, SnSe, has an ultralow thermal conductivity, but the mechanism behind the strong phonon scattering remains largely unknown. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles simulations, we mapped the four-dimensional phonon dispersion surfaces of SnSe, and found the origin of the ionic-potential anharmonicity responsible for the unique properties of SnSe. We show that the giant phonon scattering arises from an unstable electronic structure, with orbital interactions leading to a ferroelectric-like lattice instability. The present results provide a microscopic picture connecting electronic structure and phonon anharmonicity in SnSe, and offers new insights on how electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions may lead to the realization of ultralow thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {We present a novel cluster-expansion (CE) approach for the first-principles modeling of temperature and concentration dependent alloy properties. While the standard CE method includes temperature effects only via the configurational entropy in Monte Carlo simulations, our strategy also covers the first-principles free energies of lattice vibrations. To this end, the effective cluster interactions of the CE have been rendered genuinely temperature dependent, so that they can include the vibrational free energies of the input structures. As a model system we use the phase-separating alloy Fe-Cu with our focus on the Fe-rich side. There, the solubility is derived from Monte Carlo simulations, whose precision had to be increased by averaging multiple CEs. We show that including the vibrational free energy is absolutely vital for the correct first-principles prediction of Cu solubility in the bcc Fe matrix: The solubility tremendously increases and is now in quantitative agreement with experimental findings.},

abstract = {Reduced activation steels are considered as structural materials for future fusion reactors. Besides iron and the main alloying element chromium, these steels contain other minor alloying elements, typically tungsten, vanadium and tantalum. In this work we study the impact of chromium and tungsten, being major alloying elements of ferritic Fe-Cr-W-based steels, on the stability and mobility of vacancy defects, typically formed under irradiation in collision cascades. For this purpose, we perform ab initio calculations, develop a many-body interatomic potential (EAM formalism) for large-scale calculations, validate the potential and apply it using an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo method to characterize the lifetime and diffusivity of vacancy clusters. To distinguish the role of Cr and W we perform atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in Fe-Cr, Fe-W and Fe-Cr-W alloys. Within the limitation of transferability of the potentials it is found that both Cr and W enhance the diffusivity of vacancy clusters, while only W strongly reduces their lifetime. The cluster lifetime reduction increases with W concentration and saturates at about 1-2 at.{\%}. The obtained results imply that W acts as an efficient 'breaker' of small migrating vacancy clusters and therefore the short-term annealing process of cascade debris is modified by the presence of W, even in small concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Two refractory high entropy alloys with compositions near Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 and V20Nb20Mo20Ta20W20, were produced by vacuum arc-melting. Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400 °C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600 °C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 °C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30–40{\%} between room temperature and 600 °C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 °C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.},

As test cases, we select aluminum, nickel, and copper, all of them adopting the face centered cubic crystallographic structure.

abstract = {The Earth's solid core is mostly composed of iron. However, despite being central to our understanding of core properties, the stable phase of iron under inner-core conditions remains uncertain. The two leading candidates are hexagonal close-packed and body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures, but the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions has been challenged. Herewe demonstrate the stability of the bcc phase of iron under conditions consistent with the centre of the core using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.We find that the bcc phase is stabilized at high temperatures by a diffusion mechanism that arises due to the dynamical instability of the phase at lower temperatures. On the basis of our simulations, we reinterpret experimental data as support for the stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions. We suggest that the diffusion of iron atoms in solid state may explain both the anisotropy and the low shear modulus of the inner core},

@article{Bonini2012,
abstract = {We use first-principles methods based on density functional perturbation theory to characterize the lifetimes of the acoustic phonon modes and their con-sequences on the thermal transport properties of graphene. We show that using a standard perturbative approach, the transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons in free-standing graphene display finite lifetimes in the long-wavelength limit, making them ill-defined as elementary excitations in samples of dimensions larger than ∼1 $\mu$m. This behavior is entirely due to the presence of the quadratic dispersions for the out-of-plane phonon (ZA) flexural modes that appear in free-standing low-dimensional systems. Mechanical strain lifts this anomaly, and all phonons remain well-defined at any wavelength. Thermal transport is dominated by ZA modes, and the thermal conductivity is predicted to diverge with system size for any amount of strain. These findings highlight strain and sample size as key parameters in characterizing or engineering heat transport in graphene. A fter the first experimental measurement of its thermal conductivitythat reported values between 2000 and 5000 W/(mK) at room temperature, 1,2 the highest of any materialgraphene has been hailed for its extraordinary thermal transport properties and its possible applications to heat management in nanoscale devices. Many research efforts have since been devoted to understanding graphene's thermal conductivity, but the overall scenario remains complex or even controversial (see ref 3 and citations therein). On the experimental side, several groups reported quite different results for the thermal transport properties of suspended graphene. Faugeras et al., 4 studying large graphene membranes prepared via micromechanical cleavage techniques, argued that the thermal conductivity of this system may actually be not as high as initially reported: the value measured is around 600 W/(mK) at 660K, still quite high but from 5 to 8 times lower than initial room temperature estimates. Ruoff's group 5,6 investigated thermal transport in suspended and supported graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on Cu and reported a room temperature conductivity ranging from (2500 + 1100/ −1050) to (2600 ± 900 to 3100 ± 1000) W/ (mK) for suspended graphene that decreases to (370 + 650/− 320) W/(mK) for supported graphenethe latter is comparable to the thermal conductivity range of 479−680 W/(mK) recently measured for exfoliated graphene on a silicon dioxide support. 7 Recently, Lee et al. 8 reported values for the conductivity ranging from ∼1800 W/(mK) near room temperature to ∼700 W/(mK) at 500 K for mechanically exfoliated graphene. From the theoretical point of view the thermal conductivity in low-dimensional systems has been subject of great debate for many years. Numerical simulations for 2D and 1D model systems indicate that thermal conductivity depends on the size of the samplea logarithmic (power law) divergence with system size for 2D (1D) systems. 9 However, these models do not include out-of-plane (for 2D systems) or out-of-line (for 1D systems) degrees of freedom, and their ability to provide a proper description of realistic systems remains unclear. For instance, it is interesting to note that recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on carbon nanotubes 10 (quasi 1D systems) have shown that the thermal conductivity of these systems converges with system size. In the case of graphene, Klemens pointed out that the thermal conductivity above room temperature should show a logarithmic divergence with system size. 11 This conclusion is based on a model 12 that considers only the two in-plane acoustic branches [longitudinal (LA) and transverse (TA) modes] and their intrinsic relaxation rates due to anharmonic three-phonon Umklapp processes. The model, however, approximates the anharmonic coupling terms with an average},

However, in a recent transmission electron microscopy experiment, atomically thin 2D patches of iron were discovered inside a graphene nanopore. Motivated by this discovery, we perform a systematic density-functional study on atomically thin elemental 2D metal films, using 45 metals in three lattice structures. Cohesive energies, equilibrium distances, and bulk moduli in 2D are found to be linearly correlated to the corresponding 3D bulk properties, enabling the quick estimation of these values for a given 2D metal and lattice structure. In-plane elastic constants show that most 2D metals are stable in hexagonal and honeycomb, but unstable in square 2D structures. Many 2D metals are surprisingly stable against bending.},

abstract = {The dominant entropy contribution affecting defect concen- trations is configurational entropy. Other contributions such as harmonic and anharmonic lattice vibrations are second order effects and computationally expensive to calculate. Therefore, such contributions have been rarely considered in defect investigations. However, to achieve the next accuracy level in defect calculations and thus significantly improve the agree- ment with experiment, the inclusion of these contributions is critical. In this paper, we present the methods needed to compute highly accurate free energies of point defects from first principles. We demonstrate how to include all relevant free energy contributions up to the melting point. The focus will be on nonmagnetic metals and point defects in the dilute limit. We consider all relevant excitation mechanisms: electronic excitations and ionic vibrations both in the quasiharmonic approximation and explicitly including anharmonicity (i.e., phonon–phonon interaction). Since computing such interac- tions requires to sample large parts of the phase space, straightforward ab initio based simulations (such as molecular dynamics) are in most cases out of reach even on super- computers. To overcome this difficulty, a recently developed hierarchical scheme will be presented which allows to coarse grain the configuration space and thus to efficiently calculate anharmonic contributions to defect formation. We discuss the performance and accuracy of the developed methodology for the example of vacancies in aluminum. An important insight is that the entropy of vacancy formation is significantly affected by anharmonicity. We further show that the inclusion of all the aforementioned excitation mechanisms is critical to guarantee an accurate description of thermodynamic properties up to the melting point.},

We calculate the phonon lifetimes due to scattering with electrons (or holes), combine them with the intrinsic lifetimes due to the anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction, all from first-principles, and evaluate the effect of the electron-phonon interaction on the lattice thermal conductivity of silicon. Unexpectedly, we find a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature as the carrier concentration goes above 1e19 cm-3 (the reduction reaches up to 45{\%} in p-type silicon at around 1e21 cm-3), a range of great technological relevance to thermoelectric materials.},

abstract = {Koopmans-compliant functionals have been shown to provide accurate spectral properties for molecular systems; this accuracy is driven by the generalized linearization condition imposed on each charged excitation - i.e. on changing the occupation of any orbital in the system, while accounting for screening and relaxation from all other electrons. In this work we discuss the theoretical formulation and the practical implementation of this formalism to the case of extended systems, where a third condition, the localization of Koopmans' orbitals, proves crucial to reach seamlessly the thermodynamic limit. We illustrate the formalism by first studying one-dimensional molecular systems of increasing length. Then, we consider the band gaps of 30 paradigmatic solid-state test cases, for which accurate experimental and computational results are available. The results are found to be comparable with the state-of-the-art in diagrammatic techniques (self-consistent many-body perturbation theory with vertex corrections), notably using just a functional formulation for spectral properties and the physics of the generalized-gradient approximation; when ionization potentials are compared, the results are roughly twice as accurate.},

By this method, bulk samples that consist of only a single phase are generated. Sample sections consisting of 100{\%} single phase Al2Cu and of 95{\%} Q-phase, respectively, were obtained. The composition of the Q-phase was measured by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The measured concentrations are close to the Al3Cu2Mg9Si7 composition that has recently been predicted as most stable by ab initio calculations. A peritectic temperature of 703 °C for the reaction Q → L + Mg2Si + (Si) was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). An optimization of the Calphad database was performed considering the measured composition and peritectic temperature. For validating the optimized database, Scheil calculations were performed and compared with the experimentally determined sequence of solidifying phases.},

abstract = {The characterization of nanoscale clusters (nanoclusters) was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP), to clarify the com- plicated aging behavior of an Al-Mg-Si alloy. The DSC results conducted over the temperature range 223 to 473 K revealed that two types of nanoclusters, i.e., Cluster(1) and Cluster(2), were formed near room temperature (RT) and 373 K, respectively. In the present work, the quan- titative estimation of atom maps of the 3DAP analysis revealed the difference in the growth mechanism and the composition distribution of the two types of nanoclusters. The distribution of both the size andMg/Si ratio of Cluster(1) does not change during prolonged natural aging. On the other hand, Cluster(2) grows gradually with preaging time. The Mg/Si ratio of the larger-sized Cluster(2) approaches a constant value that is equal to that of the b" phase. The difference in the two-step aging behavior can be explained by the different growth mechanisms and chemical compositions of the two nanoclusters. This means that only Cluster(2) can easily transform continuously into the b" phase during the BH treatment, due to its size and compositional similarity.},

It has recently been shown that zero-point energy effects can be included comparatively cheaply in simulations of harmonic and quasiharmonic systems by augmenting classical molecular dynamics with a generalized Langevin equation (GLE). Here we describe how a similar approach can be used to accelerate the convergence of path integral (PI) molecular dynamics to the exact quantum mechanical result in more strongly anharmonic systems exhibiting both zero point energy and tunnelling effects. The resulting PI-GLE method is illustrated with applications to a double-well tunnelling problem and to liquid water.},

These techniques are alternatives to the standard thermodynamic integration method. A quantum Einstein crystal is used as a model to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of these free energy methods in quantum simulations. Our main interest focuses on the calculation of the melting temperature of Ne at ambient pressure, taking into account quantum effects in the atomic dynamics. The free energy of the solid was calculated by considering a quantum Einstein crystal as reference state, while for the liquid, the reference state was defined by the classical limit of the fluid. Our findings indicate that, while quantum effects in the melting temperature of this system are small, they still amount to about 6{\%} of the melting temperature, and are therefore not negligible. The particle density as well as the melting enthalpy and entropy of the solid and liquid phases at coexistence is compared to results obtained in the classical limit and also to available experimental data.},

abstract = {The performance of materials such as steels, their high strength and formability, is based on an impressive variety of competing mechanisms on the microscopic/atomic scale (e.g. dislocation gliding, solid solution hardening, mechanical twinning or structural phase transformations). Whereas many of the currently available concepts to describe these mechanisms are based on empirical and experimental data, it becomes more and more apparent that further improvement of materials needs to be based on a more fundamental level. Recent progress for methods based on density functional theory (DFT) now makes the exploration of chemical trends, the determination of parameters for phenomenological models and the identification of new routes for the optimization of steel properties feasible. A major challenge in applying these methods to a true materials design is, however, the inclusion of temperature-driven effects on the desired properties. Therefore, a large range of computational tools has been developed in order to improve the capability and accuracy of first-principles methods in determining free energies. These combine electronic, vibrational and magnetic effects as well as structural defects in an integrated approach. Based on these simulation tools, one is now able to successfully predict mechanical and thermodynamic properties of metals with a hitherto not achievable accuracy.},

abstract = {We show that the Gaussian Approximation Potential machine learning framework can describe complex magnetic potential energy surfaces, taking ferromagnetic iron as a paradigmatic challenging case. The training database includes total energies, forces, and stresses obtained from density-functional theory in the generalized-gradient approximation, and comprises approximately 150,000 local atomic environments, ranging from pristine and defected bulk configurations to surfaces and generalized stacking faults with different crystallographic orientations. We find the structural, vibrational and thermodynamic properties of the GAP model to be in excellent agreement with those obtained directly from first-principles electronic-structure calculations. There is good transferability to quantities, such as Peierls energy barriers, which are determined to a large extent by atomic configurations that were not part of the training set. We observe the benefit and the need of using highly converged electronic-structure calculations to sample a target potential energy surface. The end result is a systematically improvable potential that can achieve the same accuracy of density-functional theory calculations, but at a fraction of the computational cost.},

We verify that it is possible to determine an accurate many-dimensional potential by doing low dimensional fits. The final potential is a sum of terms each of which depends on a subset of the coordinates. This form facilitates quantum dynamics calculations. We use NNs to represent HDMR component functions that minimize error mode term by mode term. This NN procedure makes it possible to construct high-order component functions which in turn enable us to determine a good potential. It is shown that the number of available potential points determines the order of the HDMR which should be used. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Allen2014,
abstract = {Heat transport in nanoscale systems is both hard to measure microscopically, and hard to interpret. Ballistic and diffusive heat flow coexist, adding confusion. This paper looks at a very simple case: a nanoscale crystal repeated periodically. This is a popular model for simulation of bulk heat transport using classical molecular dynamics (MD), and is related to transient thermal grating experiments. Nanoscale effects are seen in perhaps their simplest form. The model is solved by an extension of standard quasiparticle gas theory of bulk solids. Both structure and heat flow are constrained by periodic boundary conditions. Diffusive transport is fully included, while ballistic transport by phonons of long mean free path is diminished in a specific way. Heat current J(x) and temperature gradient dT(x')/dx' have a non-local relationship, via k(x-x'), over a distance |x-x'| determined by phonon mean free paths. In MD modeling of bulk conductivity, finite computer resources limit system size. Long mean free paths, comparable to the scale of heating and cooling, cause undesired finite-size effects that have to be removed by extrapolation. The present model allows this extrapolation to be quantified. Calculations based on the Peierls-Boltzmann equation, using a generalized Debye model, show that extrapolation involves fractional powers of 1/L. It is also argued that heating and cooling should be distributed sinusoidally (de/dt{\~{}}cos(2pi x/L)) to improve convergence of numerics.},

abstract = {We have measured the pressure dependence of the width of the first-order Raman lines in Si and Ge at low temperature. The width increases linearly with hydrostatic pressure, which implies a decrease of the lifetime of the long-wavelength optical phonons. The results are compared with recent first-principles calculations of anharmonic decay into two phonons of lower energy, based on third-order density-functional perturbation theory. Provided the calculations are slightly adjusted so that the relevant frequencies agree exactly with the measured ones, the agreement for the linewidths between theory and experiment is excellent.},

abstract = {We have measured the temperature dependence of the first-order Raman scattering by phonons in Si, Ge, and a-Sn. The full widths at half maximum of the Raman lines, extrapolated to zero tem- perature, are 1.24+0.07, 0.75+0.03, and 0.81+0.15 cm ' for Si, Ge, and o,-Sn, respectively. The re- liability of the data obtained allows a critical examination of the theoretical calculations published so far. We show that the model assuming the decay of the Raman phonon into two acoustical pho- nons belonging to the same branch, first proposed by Klemens, does not represent adequately the temperature dependence of the Raman linewidth. The most important decay channels are shown to be combinations of optical and acoustical phonons. However, the more complete calculation by Cowley, which involves all possible decay channels, gives very large zero-temperature linewidths. We show that this arises mainly from the poor description of the phonon dispersion curves by the shell model used by Cowley, and that a better agreement between theory and experiment is to be ex- pected by repeating the calculation with Weber's adiabatic bond-charge model},

abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighbourhood environments, and analyse their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.},

@article{Zhu2017,
abstract = {Applying thermodynamic integration within an {\{}ab initio{\}}-based free-energy approach is a state-of-the-art method to calculate melting points of materials. However, the high computational cost and the reliance on a good reference system for calculating the liquid free energy have so far hindered a general application. To overcome these challenges, we propose the {\{}two-optimized references thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics{\}} (TOR-TILD) method in this work by extending the {\{}two-stage upsampled thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics{\}} (TU-TILD) method, which has been originally developed to obtain anharmonic free energies of solids, to the calculation of liquid free energies. The core idea of TOR-TILD is to fit two empirical potentials to the energies from density functional theory based molecular dynamics runs for the solid and the liquid phase, and to use these potentials as reference systems for thermodynamic integration. Because the empirical potentials closely reproduce the {\{}ab initio{\}} system in the relevant part of the phase space the convergence of the thermodynamic integration is very rapid. Therefore, the proposed approach improves significantly the computational efficiency while preserving the required accuracy. As a test case, we apply TOR-TILD to fcc Cu computing not only the melting point but various other melting properties, such as the entropy and enthalpy of fusion, and the volume change upon melting. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and the local-density approximation (LDA) are used. Using both functionals gives a reliable {\{}ab initio{\}} confidence interval for the melting point, the enthalpy of fusion, and entropy of fusion.},

It is an attempt to introduce density-functional theory (DFT) in a language accessible for students entering the field or researchers from other fields. It is not meant to be a scholarly review of DFT, but rather an informal guide to its conceptual basis and some recent developments and advances. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the Kohn-Sham equations are discussed in some detail. Approximate density functionals, selected aspects of applications of DFT, and a variety of extensions of standard DFT are also discussed, albeit in less detail. Throughout it is attempted to provide a balanced treatment of aspects that are relevant for chemistry and aspects relevant for physics, but with a strong bias towards conceptual foundations. The paper is intended to be read before (or in parallel with) one of the many excellent more technical reviews available in the literature.},

The fundamental mathematical questions of convergence and uniqueness of the sum of these, not absolutely convergent, series are considered. It is shown that some of the simplest direct sum methods converge and some do not converge. In particular, the very common method of expressing Madelung's constant by a series obtained from expanding spheres does not converge. The concept of analytic continuation of a complex function to provide a basis for an unambiguous mathematical definition of Madelung's constant is introduced. By these means, the simple intuitive direct sum methods and the powerful integral transformation methods, which are based on theta function identities and the Mellin transform, are brought together. A brief analysis of a hexagonal lattice is also given.},

abstract = {A possible mechanism for shock-induced failure in aluminium involves atomic vacancies diffusing through the crystal lattice and agglomerating to form voids, which continue to grow, ultimately resulting in ductile fracture. We employ orbital-free density functional theory, a linear-scaling first-principles quantum mechanics method, to study vacancy formation, diffusion, and aggregation in aluminium under shock loading conditions of compression and tension. We calculate vacancy formation and migration energies, and find that while nearest-neighbor vacancy pairs are unstable, next-nearest-neighbor vacancy pairs are stable. As the number of nearby vacancies increases, we predict that vacancy clusters preferentially grow through next-nearest-neighbor vacancies. The energetics are found to be greatly affected by expansion and compression, leading to insight as to how vacancies behave under shock conditions.},

abstract = {In recent years, palladium has proven to be a crucial component for devices ranging from nanotube field effect transistors to advanced hydrogen storage devices. In this work, I examine the phonon dispersion of fcc Pd using first principle calculations based on density functional perturbation theory. While several groups in the past have studied the acoustic properties of palladium, this is the first study to reproduce the phonon dispersion and associated anomaly with high accuracy and no adjustable parameters. In particular, I focus on the Kohn anomaly in the [110] direction.},

abstract = {Co-clusters in ternary or higher order metallic alloys are metastable structures involving two or more distinct alloying atoms that retain the structure of the host lattice. A thermodynamic model based on a single interaction energy of dissimilar nearest neighbour interaction energy is presented, and a model for the strengthening due to these co-cluster dimers is derived. The model includes a new treatment of (short-range) order strengthening relevant to these co-clusters and further encompasses modulus hardening and chemical hardening. The models are tested against data on a wide range of Al-Cu-Mg alloys treated at temperatures between 20 and 220 °C. Both quantitative calorimetry data on the enthalpy change due to co-cluster formation and strengthening due to co-clusters is predicted well. It is shown that in general (short-range) order strengthening will be the main strengthening mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a general procedure by which nonlinear power spectral densities (PSDs) of the harmonic oscillator can be calculated in both the quantum and classical regimes. We begin with an introduction of the damped and undamped classical harmonic oscillator, followed by an overview of the quantum mechanical description of this system. A brief review of both the classical and quantum autocorrelation functions (ACFs) and PSDs follow. We then introduce a general method by which the kth-order PSD for the harmonic oscillator can be calculated, where {\$}k{\$} is any positive integer. This formulation is verified by first reproducing the known results for the {\$}k = 1{\$} case of the linear PSD. It is then extended to calculate the second-order PSD, useful in the field of quantum measurement, corresponding to the {\$}k = 2{\$} case of the generalized method. In this process, damping is included into each of the quantum linear and quadratic PSDs, producing realistic models for the PSDs found in experiment. These quantum PSDs are shown to obey the correspondence principle by matching with what was calculated for their classical counterparts in the high temperature, high-Q limit. Finally, we demonstrate that our results can be reproduced using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, providing an independent check of our resultant PSDs.},

abstract = {We explore the competition and coupling of vibrational and electronic contributions to the heat capacity of Al and Al 3 Sc at temperatures below 50 K, combining experimental calorimetry with highly converged finite-temperature density functional theory calculations. We find that semilocal exchange-correlation functionals accurately describe the rich feature set observed for these temperatures, including electron-phonon coupling. Using different representations of the heat capacity, we are therefore able to identify and explain deviations from the Debye behavior in the low-temperature limit and in the temperature regime 30–50 K as well as the reduction of these features due to the addition of Sc.},

abstract = {A method is introduced to stochastically generate crystal structures with defined structural characteristics. Reasonable quotient graphs for symmetric crystals are constructed using a random strategy combined with space group and graph theory. Our algorithm enables the search for large-size and complex crystal structures with a specified connectivity, such as threefold sp2 carbons, fourfold sp3 carbons, as well as mixed sp2−sp3 carbons. To demonstrate the method, we randomly construct initial structures adhering to space groups from 75 to 230 and a range of lattice constants, and we identify 281 new sp3 carbon crystals. First-principles optimization of these structures show that most of them are dynamically and mechanically stable and are energetically comparable to those previously proposed. Some of the new structures can be considered as candidates to explain the experimental cold compression of graphite.},

abstract = {The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

abstract = {The empirical Neumann-Kopp rule (NKR) for the estimation of temperature dependence of heat capacity of mixed oxide is analyzed. NKR gives a reasonable estimate of Cpm for most mixed oxides around room temperature, but at both low and high temperatures the accuracy of the estimate is substantially lowered. At very low temperatures, the validity of NKR is shown to be predominantly determined by the relation between the characteristic Debye and Einstein temperatures of a mixed oxide and its constituents. At high temperatures, the correlation between their molar volumes, volume expansion coefficients and compressibilities takes the dominance. In cases where the formation of a mixed oxide is not accompanied by any volume change, the difference between dilatation contributions to heat capacity of a mixed oxide and its constituents is exclusively negative. It turns out that in the high-temperature range, where the contribution of harmonic lattice vibrations approached the 3NR limit, $\Delta$oxCp assumes negative values. For more complex oxides whose heat capacity has contributions from terms such as magnetic ordering, electronic excitations, the applicability of NKR is only restricted to lattice and dilatation terms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Gibbs free energy is the fundamental thermodynamic potential underlying the relative stability of different states of matter under constant-pressure conditions. However, computing this quantity from atomic-scale simulations is far from trivial. As a consequence, all too often the potential energy of the system is used as a proxy, overlooking entropic and anharmonic effects. Here we discuss a combination of different thermodynamic integration routes to obtain the absolute Gibbs free energy of a solid system starting from a harmonic reference state. This approach enables the direct comparison between the free energy of different structures, circumventing the need to sample the transition paths between them. We showcase this thermodynamic integration scheme by computing the Gibbs free energy associated with a vacancy in BCC iron, and the intrinsic stacking fault free energy of nickel. These examples highlight the pitfalls of estimating the free energy of crystallographic defects only using the minimum potential energy, which overestimates the vacancy free energy by 60{\%} and the stacking-fault energy by almost 300{\%} at temperatures close to the melting point.},

This behavior is unexpected and very different from hydrogen's role in other semiconductors, in which it acts only as a compensating center and always counteracts the prevailing conductivity. These insights have important consequences for control and utilization of hydrogen in oxides in general.},

The configuration state functions are products of ground-state occupied and virtual modals obtained using the vibrational self-consistent field method. The Gilbert and Jordan potential energy surface was used for the calculations. The resulting partition function was used to test the harmonic oscillator approximation and the separable-rotation approximation. The harmonic oscillator, rigid-rotator approximation is in error by a factor of 2.3 at 300 K, but we also propose a separable-rotation approximation that is accurate within 2{\%} from 100 to 1000 K.},

The struggle toward this revolution was foreshadowed by a Victorian novelist and championed,unsuccessfully, by dogged physicists in the 1960s to 1980s who had a workable theory but uncompliant materials. Discovery of superconductivity of H{\$}{\_}3{\$}S at 200 K in the 160-200 GPa pressure range has renewed anticipation of yet higher values of the critical temperature T{\$}{\_}c{\$}. With the several reports of metalization of hydrogen, and theoretical extensions enabled by modern algorithms and unprecedented computational hardware and spurred forward by the Materials Genome Initiative, it is possible that the room temperature precipice has thereby already been breached in a silent revolution. This concise note draws analogies of this development with an earlier revolution.},

abstract = {The melting curve of aluminum is determined up to 300 GPa using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculations are based on density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation. We simulate the melting with two methods, the one-phase or heat until it melts and the two-phase approaches. The first one corresponds to a homogeneous melting, while the second one involves a heterogeneous melting of the materials. This conceptual difference gives rise to melting temperatures which can noticeably differ. As expected we observe a melting temperature overestimation in the one-phase approach compared to the two-phase approach. To reduce this overheating we use the hysteresis and the Z method which try to combine the advantage of both techniques. We finally compare our theoretical data with experiments and we discuss the pertinence and the use of the methods},

abstract = {Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) alloys form the basis of a wide variety of commercial precipitation-hardened alloys, and the observed precipitation sequence in these alloys is complex and involves a wide variety of metastable phases (e.g. GP zones, $\beta$″, U1, U2, B′, $\beta$′). Calculations of metastable phase equilibria in these alloys are virtually nonexistent due to the lack of quantitative information on the thermodynamics of the precipitate phases. We have undertaken an extensive, systematic first-principles study of energetics of all the reported precipitate phases of Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) alloys, using density functional-based calculations in both the local density and generalized gradient approximations. Our calculations help clarify the energetics of the metastable precipitate phases, and in certain cases, provide insight into the compositional changes of precipitates during aging. In addition to energetics, we also examine the relative volumes of the various phases, and discuss cases of significant deviation from that of the solid solution. {\textcopyright} 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

The interaction between electrons is accounted for by using a momentum independent self-energy obeying the Luttinger theorem. It is observed in one-dimensional systems that the amplitude of oscillations is systematically damped with increasing the interaction while the period remains unchanged. The variation of screening charge with the impurity potential is discussed. We see that the screening charge is suppressed by the interactions. In case of two-dimensional systems the surface oscillations around the impurity are more localized with increasing the interactions.},

Additionally, the existing experimental data have been complemented by new measurements of the Fe projected phonon density of states performed for the Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}Pt and FePt{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} thin films using the nuclear inelastic scattering technique. The calculated phonon dispersion relations and phonon density of states have been compared with the experimental data. The dispersion curves are very well reproduced by the calculations, although, the softening of the transversal acoustic mode TA{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} leads to some discrepancy between the theory and experiment in Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}Pt. A very good agreement between the measured spectra and calculations performed for the tetragonal structure derived from the soft mode may signal that the tetragonal phase with the space group P4/mbm plays an important role in the martensitic transformation observed in Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}Pt. For FePt{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, the antiferromagnetic order appearing with decreasing temperature has been also investigated.

Using experimental and theoretical probes of the local structure, we demonstrate this behavior in binary lead chalcogenides, which were believed to adopt the ideal, undistorted rock-salt structure at all temperatures. The behavior is consistent with a simple thermodynamic model in which the emerging dipoles are stabilized in the disordered state at high temperature due to the extra configurational entropy despite the fact that the undistorted structure has lower internal energy. Our findings shed light on the anomalous electronic and thermoelectric properties of the lead chalcogenides. Similar searches may show that the phenomenon is more widespread.},

abstract = {Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is therefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a quantum state truly represents. One possibility is that a pure quantum state corresponds directly to reality. However, there is a long history of suggestions that a quantum state (even a pure state) represents only knowledge or information about some aspect of reality. Here we show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical state of the system, and in which systems that are prepared independently have independent physical states, must make predictions which contradict those of quantum theory.},

@article{Itakura2016,
abstract = {Compared to cubic metals, whose primary slip mode includes twelve equivalent systems, the lower crystalline symmetry of hexagonal close-packed metals results in a reduced number of equivalent primary slips and anisotropy in plasticity, leading to brittleness at the ambient temperature. At higher temperatures, the ductility of hexagonal close-packed metals improves owing to the activation of secondary c+a pyramidal slip systems. Thus understanding the fundamental properties of corresponding dislocations is essential for the improvement of ductility at the ambient temperature. Here, we present the results of large-scale ab-initio calculations for c+a pyramidal screw dislocations in Mg and show that their slip behavior is a stark counterexample to the conventional wisdom that a slip plane is determined by the stacking fault plane of dislocations. A stacking fault between dissociated partial dislocations can assume a non-planar shape with a negligible energy cost and can migrate normal to its plane by a local shuffling of atoms. Partial dislocations dissociated on a {\{}2-1-12{\}} plane "slither" in the {\{}01-11{\}} plane, dragging the stacking fault with them in response to an applied shear stress. This finding resolves the apparent discrepancy that both {\{}2-1-12{\}} and {\{}01-11{\}} slip traces are observed in experiments while ab-initio calculations indicate that dislocations preferably dissociate in the {\{}01-11{\}} planes.},

abstract = {We present a method by which first-principles calculations are linked quite naturally to experimental observables, which determine and characterize the state of an electrochemical system. The method is based on the formation energies of ions in solution and utilizes a grand canonical framework. This is particularly well suited to use in conjunction with ab initio calculations, since it allows charged defects to be treated individually, rather than requiring the consideration of full charge-neutral reactions. It allows the identification of a region of water stability, the pH scale, and the electrode potential. We discuss and demonstrate the possibilities and capabilities of the approach by the extraction of ion-hydration energies from the Nernst equation and the construction of a potential/pH diagram for zinc by an alternative route deviating from the standard approach used to obtain Pourbaix diagrams.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Detailed understanding of vibrational heat transfer mechanisms between solids is essential for the efficient thermal engineering and control of nanomaterials. We investigate the frequency dependence of inelastic scattering and interfacial thermal conduction by calculating the spectral decomposition of the heat current flowing through an interface between two materials. The calculations are based on analyzing the correlations of atomic vibrations using the data extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Inelastic effects arising from anharmonic interactions are shown to significantly facilitate heat transfer between two mass-mismatched face-centered cubic lattices even at frequencies exceeding the cut-off frequency of the heavier material due to (i) enhanced dissipation of evanescent vibrational modes and (ii) frequency-doubling and frequency-halving three-phonon energy transfer processes at the interface. The results provide substantial insight into interfacial energy transfer mechanisms especially at high temperatures, where inelastic effects become important and other computational methods are ineffective.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

abstract = {We present a method to obtain the frequency spectrum of a signal with a nonlinear dynamical system. The dynamical system is composed of a pool of adaptive frequency oscillators with negative mean-field coupling. For the frequency analysis, the synchronization and adaptation properties of the component oscillators are exploited. The frequency spectrum of the signal is reflected in the statistics of the intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators. The frequency analysis is completely embedded in the dynamics of the system. Thus, no pre-processing or additional parameters, such as time windows, are needed. Representative results of the numerical integration of the system are presented. It is shown, that the oscillators tune to the correct frequencies for both discrete and continuous spectra. Due to its dynamic nature the system is also capable to track non-stationary spectra. Further, we show that the system can be modeled in a probabilistic manner by means of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. The probabilistic treatment is in good agreement with the numerical results, and provides a useful tool to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to convergence. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The phase equilibria and invariant reactions in the system Al-Cu-Si were investigated by a combination of optical microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). Isothermal phase equilibria were investigated within two isothermal sections. The isothermal section at 500 °C covers the whole ternary composition range and largely confirms the findings of previous phase diagram investigations. The isothermal section at 700 °C describes phase equilibria only in the complex Cu-rich part of the phase diagram. A new ternary compound $\tau$ was found in the region between (Al,Cu)-$\gamma$(1) and (Cu,Si)-$\gamma$ and its solubility range was determined. The solubility of Al in $\kappa$-CuSi was found to be extremely high at 700 °C. In contrast, no ternary solubility in the $\beta$-phase of Cu-Al was found, although this phase is supposed to form a complete solid solution according to previous phase diagram assessments. Two isopleths, at 10 and 40 at.{\%} Si, were investigated by means of DTA and a partial ternary reaction scheme (Scheil diagram) was constructed, based on the current work and the latest findings in the binary systems Al-Cu and Cu-Si. The current study shows that the high temperature equilibria in the Cu-rich corner are still poorly understood and additional studies in this area would be favorable.},

abstract = {Multicomponent alloys with multiple principal elements including high entropy alloys (HEAs) and compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) are attracting rapidly growing attention. The endless possibilities to explore new alloys and the hope for better combinations of materials properties have stimulated a remarkable number of research works in the last years. Most of these works have been based on experimental approaches, but ab initio calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiment and serves as a predictive tool for the identification and characterization of promising alloys. The theoretical ab initio modeling of phase stabilities and mechanical properties of multi-principal element alloys by means of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed. A general thermodynamic framework is laid down that provides a bridge between the quantities accessible with DFT and the targeted thermodynamic and mechanical properties. It is shown how chemical disorder and various finite-temperature excitations can be modeled with DFT. Different concepts to study crystal and alloy phase stabilities, the impact of lattice distortions (a core effect of HEAs), magnetic transitions, and chemical short-range order are discussed along with specific examples. Strategies to study elastic properties, stacking fault energies, and their dependence on, e.g., temperature or alloy composition are illustrated. Finally, we provide an extensive compilation of multi-principal element alloys and various material properties studied with DFT so far (a set of over 500 alloy-property combinations).},

abstract = {Inspired by high-entropy alloys, we study the design of steels that are based on high configurational entropy for stabilizing a single-phase solid solution matrix. The focus is placed on the system Fe-Mn-Al-Si-C but we also present trends in the alloy system Fe-Mn-Al-C. Unlike in conventional high-entropy alloys, where five or more equiatomically proportioned components are used, we exploit the flat configurational entropy plateau in transition metal mixtures, stabilizing solid solutions also for lean, non-equiatomic compositions. This renders the high-entropy alloying concept, where none of the elements prevails, into a class of Fe-based materials which we refer to as high-entropy steels. A point that has received little attention in high-entropy alloys is the use of interstitial elements. Here, we address the role of C in face-centered cubic solid solution phases. High-entropy steels reveal excellent mechanical properties, namely, very high ductility and toughness; excellent high rate and low-temperature ductility; high strength of up to 1 GPa; up to 17{\%} reduced mass density; and very high strain hardening. The microstructure stability can be tuned by adjusting the stacking fault energy. This enables to exploit deformation effects such as the TRIP, TWIP, or precipitation determined mechanisms. We present a class of massive solid solution steels with high configurational entropy. Focus is placed on the system Fe-Mn-Al-Si-C, i.e., considering also C interstitials. By exploiting the flat configurational entropy plateau in metal mixtures, solid solutions of lean, non-equiatomic compositions can be stabilized. This renders the high-entropy alloying concept, where none of the elements prevails, into high-entropy steels.},

The two degrees of freedom are dynamically coupled leading to non-adiabatic effects. Those effects suppress the phonon life times at low temperature compared to an adiabatic approach. The here identified dynamic coupling provides an explanation for the experimentally observed unexpected temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of magnetic semiconductors above the magnetic ordering temperature.},

Both a conventional Dunham-type analysis and a direct-potential-fit (DPF) analysis represent the data within (on average) the estimated experimental uncertainties. However, the Dunham-type parameters do not yield realistic predictions outside the range of the data used in the analysis, while the potential function obtained from the DPF treatment yields quantum mechanical accuracy over the data region and realistic predictions of the energies and properties of unobserved higher vibrational levels. Our DPF analysis also introduces a compact new analytic potential function form which incorporates the two leading inverse-power terms in the long-range potential.},

Using interaction parameters deduced from the matrix compositions in over-aged samples measured using 3-dimensional atom probe, the simulation has successfully reproduced early-stage metastable GPI zone precipitation behaviour including evolution of the cluster chemistry, the cluster number density and cluster size. The simulation has revealed the effect of strong Mg-vacancy interaction on the composition of small clusters and has indicated that there is Zn enrichment of some clusters, which further explains previous experimental observation of smaller GPI zones transforming to $\eta$′ precipitates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The microscopic physics behind low-lattice thermal conductivity of single-crystal rock salt lead telluride (PbTe) is investigated. Mode-dependent phonon (normal and umklapp) scattering rates and their impact on thermal conductivity were quantified by first-principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations that accurately reproduce thermal conductivity in a wide temperature range. The low thermal conductivity of PbTe is attributed to the scattering of longitudinal acoustic phonons by transverse optical phonons with large anharmonicity and small group velocity of the soft transverse acoustic phonons. This results in enhancing the relative contribution of optical phonons, which are usually minor heat carriers in bulk materials.},

abstract = {Mode-dependent phonon and electron transport properties in Al, Ag, and Au are predicted using density functional theory and lattice dynamics calculations. The predicted thermal conductivities, electrical conductivities, electron-phonon coupling coefficients, and electron-phonon mass enhancement parameters are in agreement with experimental measurements. At a temperature of 100 K, the phonon contribution to the total thermal conductivity of Al is 5{\%} in bulk and increases to 15{\%} for a 50 nm thick film. In all three metals, phonons with mean free paths between 1 and 10 nm are the dominate contributors to the thermal conductivity at a temperature of 300 K, while the relevant electron mean free paths are 10–100 nm. Despite similar atomic masses, the phonon thermal conductivity of Al is an order of magnitude smaller than that of silicon due to a larger three-phonon phase space and stronger anharmonicity. These results will impact the interpretation of thermoreflectance experiments that can resolve carrier-level contributions to thermal conductivity. There have been significant advances in the prediction of phonon properties and thermal conductivity in semi-conductors from first principles [1–5]. Phonon transport in metals is mostly untouched, however, because of the small contribution of phonons to bulk thermal conductivity [6,7] and the computational complexity of rigorously modeling electron-phonon (e-p) interactions. Even though electrons dominate thermal and electrical transport in metals, phonons play a critical role in that the electron transport is limited by e-p scattering at intermediate and high temperatures (i.e., above one-tenth of the Debye temperature) [6,8]. Furthermore, e-p interactions are important in superconductivity [9], hot-carrier mobility [10,11], the response of a material abruptly heated by ion bombardment or laser irradiation [12,13], and thermal transport across metal-dielectric interfaces in thermo-electric [14,15] and plasmonic [16] devices. Separating and quantifying the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity in metals is needed to model electron-phonon nonequilibrium using a two-temperature model, for example, in the analysis of thermoreflectance experiments that can resolve carrier-level contributions to thermal conductivity [9,17–21]. Our objective is to predict the mode-dependent phonon transport properties and thermal conductivity of the non-magnetic face-centered-cubic metals aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) from first principles by considering phonon-phonon (p-p) and e-p interactions. We will also predict mode-dependent electron transport properties and from these, the electron thermal and electrical conductivities. Electron-impurity and electron-electron interactions are not important at the temperatures of interest (100–500 K; the Debye temperatures of Al, Ag, and Au are 428, 225, and 165 K) and are not considered. Mode-dependent properties are essential for understanding the origin of macroscopically observable properties and for predicting the behavior of nanostructured materials. The predictions are made from first principles using density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and lattice dynamics * mcgaughey@cmu.edu},

AUIDs (Aflowlib Unique IDentifier) and AURLs (Aflowlib Uniform Resource Locator) are assigned to the database resources according to a well-defined protocol described herein, which enables the client to access, through appropriate queries, the desired data for post-processing. This introduces a new level of openness into the AFLOWLIB repository, allowing the community to construct high-level work-flows and tools exploiting its rich data set of calculated structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties.

In this paper, we report an extension of the previously published confinement method (J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 17212-20) to fluid simulations. Absolute free energies of liquid argon and liquid water are obtained accurately and compared with results from thermodynamic integration. The method works by transforming the liquid state into a harmonic, solid reference state. This is achieved using a special restraint potential that allows molecules to change their restraint position during the simulation, which circumvents the need for the molecules to sample the full extent of their translational freedom. The absolute free energy of the completely restrained reference state is obtained from a normal mode calculation. Because of the generic reference state used, the method is applicable to nonhomogeneous, diffusive systems and could provide an alternative method in situations in which solute annihilation fails due to the size of the solute. Potential applications include calculation of solvation energies of large molecules and free energies of peptide conformational changes in explicit solvent.},

abstract = {The idea of superconductivity without the mediating role of lattice vibrations (phonons) has a long history. It was realized soon after the publication of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity 50 years ago that a full treatment of both the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the electron predicts the existence of attractive components of the effective interaction between electrons even in the absence of lattice vibrations--a particular example is the effective interaction that depends on the relative spins of the electrons. Such attraction without phonons can lead to electronic pairing and to unconventional forms of superconductivity that can be much more sensitive than traditional (BCS) superconductivity to the precise details of the crystal structure and to the electronic and magnetic properties of a material.},

Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. However, Cartesian coordinates are not a good choice to represent the atomic positions, and a transformation to symmetry functions is required. Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail. The symmetry functions are general and can be applied to all types of systems such as molecules, crystalline and amorphous solids, and liquids.},

abstract = {The melting point of aluminum has been obtained in an ab initio molecular dynamics calculation by determination of the free energies of the solid and liquid phases as a function of temperature along the zero pressure isobar. The focus of the article is to demonstrate the problems which can arise in obtaining adequately sampled free energies. The time scale on which "adiabatic switching" may be performed to calculate the free energy of the ab initio system relative to a classical reference state is discussed. To provide a consistency check, two reference states for this thermodynamic integration are used, the one component plasma and the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system. These illustrate particular difficulties which can arise. In the LJ case, for example, the intermediate fluid states which arise in integrating from the LJ fluid to the full ab initio description of Al are found to freeze. Ultimately, consistent results are obtained. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0021- 9606(00)70438-7].},

The three intermediate Na-Sn phases that form during sodiation have X-ray diffraction patterns that do not correspond to any known equilibrium phase of Na-Sn.

abstract = {The Earth's solid core is mostly composed of iron. However, despite being central to our understanding of core properties, the stable phase of iron under inner-core conditions remains uncertain. The two leading candidates are hexagonal close-packed and body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures, but the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions has been challenged. Herewe demonstrate the stability of the bcc phase of iron under conditions consistent with the centre of the core using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.We find that the bcc phase is stabilized at high temperatures by a diffusion mechanism that arises due to the dynamical instability of the phase at lower temperatures. On the basis of our simulations, we reinterpret experimental data as support for the stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions. We suggest that the diffusion of iron atoms in solid state may explain both the anisotropy and the low shear modulus of the inner core},

A parametrized temperature-dependent modification of the vibrational density of states designed to be used directly with the quasiharmonic free-energy expression is proposed. An approximate relationship between the modified frequencies and the renormalized frequencies is developed. This parametrization is shown to produce the correct low and high temperature behavior of the anharmonic free energy and other thermodynamics properties. It is shown that the thermodynamics properties of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Mg2SiO4 (forsterite and wadsleyite) and MgO (periclase) improve considerably after inclusion of anharmonic effects. Anharmonicity is shown to have a significant effect on the phase boundary of the forsterite to wadsleyite transformation. Inclusion of anharmonic effects can reconcile discrepancies between the measurements of the Clapeyron slope of this transition and the values predicted by quasiharmonic calculations.},

@article{Mills2006,
abstract = {The claim that quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the most successful theory in history is critically evaluated. The Dirac equation was postulated in 1926 as a means to remedy the nonrelativistic nature of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation to provide the missing fourth quantum number. The positive and negative square root terms provided an argument for the existence of negative energy states of the vacuum, virtual particles, and corresponding so-called QED computer algorithms for cal-culating unexpected observables such as the Lamb shift and the anomalous mag-netic moment of the electron. Dirac's original attempt to solve the bound electron physically with stability with respect to radiation according to Maxwell's equa-tions, with the further constraints that it be relativistically invariant and give rise to electron spin, is achievable using a classical approach. Starting with the same essential physics as Bohr, Schr{\"{o}}dinger, and Dirac of e – moving in the Coulombic field of the proton and the wave equation as an equation of motion rather than energy after Schr{\"{o}}dinger, advancements in the understanding of the stability of the bound electron to radiation are applied to solve for the exact nature of the electron. Rather than using the postulated Schr{\"{o}}dinger boundary condition " $\Psi$ → 0 as r → ∞, " which leads to a purely mathematical model of the electron, the constraint is based on experimental observation. Using Maxwell's equations, the classical wave equation is solved with the constraint that the bound (n = 1)-state electron cannot radiate energy. Although it is well known that an accelerated point particle radiates, an extended distribution modeled as a superposition of accelerating charges does not have to radiate. A simple invariant physical model arises naturally wherein the predicted results are extremely straightforward and internally consistent, requiring minimal mathematics, as in the case of the most fa-mous equations of Newton, Maxwell, Lorentz, de Broglie, and Planck on which the model is based. No new physics is needed; only the known physical laws based on direct observation are used. Rather than invoking untestable " flights of fancy, " the results of QED, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, the Lamb shift, the fine structure and hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom, and the hy-perfine structure intervals of positronium and muonium, can be solved exactly from Maxwell's equations to the limit possible based on experimental measurements, which confirms QED's illegitimacy as representative of reality.},

abstract = {Molecular statics and molecular dynamics simulations are presented for the structure and glide motion of a/2〈111〉 dislocations in a randomly-distributed model-BCC Co16.67Fe36.67Ni16.67Ti30alloy. Core structure variations along an individual dislocation line are found for a/2〈111〉 screw and edge dislocations. One reason for the core structure variations is the local variation in composition along the dislocation line. Calculated unstable stacking fault energies on the (110) plane as a function of composition vary significantly, consistent with this assessment. Molecular dynamics simulations of the critical glide stress as a function of temperature show significant strengthening, and much shallower temperature dependence of the strengthening, as compared to pure BCC Fe as well as a reference mean-field BCC alloy material of the same overall composition, lattice and elastic constants as the target alloy. Interpretation of the strength versus temperature in terms of an effective kink-pair activation model shows the random alloy to have a much larger activation energy than the mean-field alloy or BCC Fe. This is interpreted as due to the core structure variations along the dislocation line that are often unfavorable for glide in the direction of the load. The configuration of the gliding dislocation is wavy, and significant debris is left behind, demonstrating the role of local composition and core structure in creating kink pinning (super jogs) and/or deflection of the glide plane of the dislocation.},

To analyze the dynamics of complex systems, rigid-body motions of arbitrarily chosen molecular subunits can be studied. All modules use a common input data structure for the MD trajectory files which facilitates an efficient calculation of time correlation functions by Fast Fourier Transform algorithms. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Size-extensive generalizations of the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF), vibrational Moller-Plesset perturbation (VMP), and vibrational coupled-cluster (VCC) methods are made to anharmonic lattice vibrations of extended periodic systems on the basis of a quartic force field (QFF) in delocalized normal coordinates. Copious terms in the formalisms of VSCF that have nonphysical size dependence are identified algebraically and eliminated, leading to compact and strictly size-extensive equations. This "quartic" VSCF method (qVSCF) thus defined has no contributions from cubic force constants and alters only the transition energies of the underlying harmonic-oscillator reference from a subset of quartic force constants. It also provides a way to evaluate an anharmonic correction to the lattice structure due to cubic force constants of a certain type. The second-order VMP and VCC methods in the QFF based on the qVSCF reference are shown to account for anharmonic effects due to all cubic and quartic force constants in a size-extensive fashion. These methods can be readily extended to a higher-order truncated Taylor expansion of a potential energy surface in normal coordinates. An algebraic proof of the lack of size-extensivity in the vibrational configuration-interaction method is also presented.},

abstract = {Crystals and glasses exhibit fundamentally different heat conduction mechanisms: the periodicity of crystals allows for the excitation of propagating vibrational waves that carry heat, as first discussed by Peierls; in glasses, the lack of periodicity breaks Peierls' picture and heat is mainly carried by the coupling of vibrational modes, often described by a harmonic theory introduced by Allen and Feldman. Anharmonicity or disorder are thus the limiting factors for thermal conductivity in crystals or glasses; hitherto, no transport equation has been able to account for both. Here, we derive such equation, resulting in a thermal conductivity that reduces to the Peierls and Allen-Feldman limits, respectively, in anharmonic-and-ordered or harmonic-and-disordered solids, while also covering the intermediate regimes where both effects are relevant. This approach also solves the long-standing problem of accurately predicting the thermal properties of crystals with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity, as we show with an application to a thermoelectric material representative of this class.},

@article{Ceriotti2014b,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics can be used as a very e ective, general-purpose approach to generate atomic con gurations for a material or chemical compound that are consistent with prescribed experimental conditions. It is an ideal companion to ab initio electronic structure methods, that allow one to evaluate the inter-atomic forces from rst principles, avoiding the time-consuming and at times inaccurate process of designing an empirical model. Unfortunately, ab initio methods are still computationally demanding, and so it is desirable to modify the properties of the dynamics to get a more e ective exploration of phase space than allowed by the intrinsic system's dynamics. A very e ective approach to manipulate the sampling behaviour of a molecular dynamics simulation exploits non-Markovian, Generalized Langevin Equations (GLEs) that have been used in the past to model the coupling of the system with a physical bath. Within this framework, the impact of the correlated noise on static and dynamic properties of the trajectory can be predicted analytically in the harmonic limit. One can therefore optimize the performances of the GLE a priori, and obtain e ects that range from e ective sampling of all the relevant time scales, to ne-tuned control of the disturbance of dynamics for di erent frequency ranges, to the design of non-equilibrium trajectories that can be used to model zero-point energy and other nuclear quantum e ects and even to evaluate matrix functions with linear scaling e ort. Correlated noise can also be combined with imaginary time path integral molecular dynamics, to obtain fast and systematic convergence of properties that depend on the quantum nature of light nuclei {\{} that are paramount for materials that contain hydrogen. This review will introduce the theoretical basis of the GLE thermostat framework and will brie y discuss the many ways it can be used to manipulate the sampling properties of molecular dynamics. The practical implementation will also be covered, and a few selected applications in the context of ab initio molecular dynamics will be presented as examples.}},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing classical force fields constitute the cornerstone of contemporary atomistic modeling in chemistry, biology, and materials science. However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.},

abstract = {Epitaxial strain energies of epitaxial films and bulk superlattices are studied via first-principles total energy calculations using the local-density approximation. Anharmonic effects due to large lattice mismatch, beyond the reach of the harmonic elasticity theory, are found to be very important in Cu/Au (lattice mismatch 12{\%}), Cu/Ag (12{\%}) and Ni/Au (15{\%}). We find that {\textless}001{\textgreater} is the elastically soft direction for biaxial expansion of Cu and Ni, but it is {\textless}201{\textgreater} for large biaxial compression of Cu, Ag, and Au. The stability of superlattices is discussed in terms of the coherency strain and interfacial energies. We find that in phase-separating systems such as Cu-Ag the superlattice formation energies decrease with superlattice period, and the interfacial energy is positive. Superlattices are formed easiest on (001) and hardest on (111) substrates. For ordering systems, such as Cu-Au and Ag-Au, the formation energy of superlattices increases with period, and interfacial energies are negative. These superlattices are formed easiest on (001) or (110) and hardest on (111) substrates. For Ni-Au we find a hybrid behavior: superlattices along {\textless}111{\textgreater} and {\textless}001{\textgreater} like in phase-separating systems, while for {\textless}110{\textgreater} they behave like in ordering systems. Finally, recent experimental results on epitaxial stabilization of disordered Ni-Au and Cu-Ag alloys, immiscible in the bulk form, are explained in terms of destabilization of the phase separated state due to lattice mismatch between the substrate and constituents.},

abstract = {Silicene, the silicon-based counterpart of graphene with a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, has attracted tremendous interest both theoretically and experimentally due to its significant potential industrial applications. From the aspect of theoretical study, the widely used classical molecular dynamics simulation is an appropriate way to investigate the transport phenomena and mechanisms in nanostructures such as silicene. Unfortunately, no available interatomic potential can precisely characterize the unique features of silicene. Here, we optimized the Stillinger-Weber potential parameters specifically for a single-layer Si sheet, which can accurately reproduce the low buckling structure of silicene and the full phonon dispersion curves obtained from ab initio calculations. By performing equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations with the new potential, we reveal that the three methods consistently yield an extremely low thermal conductivity of silicene and a short phonon mean-free path, suggesting silicene as a potential candidate for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Moreover, by qualifying the relative contributions of lattice vibrations in different directions, we found that the longitudinal phonon modes dominate the thermal transport in silicene, which is fundamentally different from graphene, despite the similarity of their two-dimensional honeycomb lattices.},

These two effects, intensity, and profile asymmetries, give access to the local properties of CDW in disordered systems, including the pinning and even the phase shift of Friedel oscillations.},

abstract = {We present a novel scheme to accurately predict atomic forces as vector quantities, rather than sets of scalar components, by Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. This is based on matrix-valued kernel functions, on which we impose the requirements that the predicted force rotates with the target configuration and is independent of any rotations applied to the configuration database entries. We show that such covariant GP kernels can be obtained by integration over the elements of the rotation group SO(d) for the relevant dimensionality d. Remarkably, in specific cases the integration can be carried out analytically and yields a conservative force field that can be recast into a pair interaction form. Finally, we show that restricting the integration to a summation over the elements of a finite point group relevant to the target system is sufficient to recover an accurate GP. The accuracy of our kernels in predicting quantum-mechanical forces in real materials is investigated by tests on pure and defective Ni, Fe and Si crystalline systems.},

abstract = {The formation of precipitates in metallic alloys is determined by a two-way chemomechanical coupling. While the dependence on solute diffusion is apparent, the opposite effect, namely the impact of nanoprecipitates on the diffusion, is highlighted in the present paper. Using severe plastic deformation and post-deformation annealing of an Al-based alloy, different microstructures and sizes of Al 3 Sc-based nanoprecipitates are produced. The enhanced diffusion along grain boundaries in the so-called C-type kinetic regime is used as a probe to ensure a well-defined distance of the diffusion path from the precipitates and to prohibit their evolution during measurements. Tracer measurements with the radioisotope 57 Co reveal a remarkable nonmonotonic dependence of the diffusion rates on the annealing temperature. It has been fully explained by an ab initio informed phenomenological model that considers the elastic stress around the coherent and noncoherent precipitates.},

@article{Willatt2018,
abstract = {Machine-learning of atomic-scale properties amounts to extracting correlations between structure, composition and the quantity that one wants to predict. Representing the input structure in a way that best reflects such correlations makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the model for a given amount of reference data. When using a description of the structures that is transparent and well-principled, optimizing the representation might reveal insights into the chemistry of the data set. Here we show how one can generalize the SOAP kernel to introduce a distance-dependent weight that accounts for the multi-scale nature of the interactions, and a description of correlations between chemical species. We show that this improves substantially the performance of ML models of molecular and materials stability, while making it easier to work with complex, multi-component systems and to extend SOAP to coarse-grained intermolecular potentials. The element correlations that give the best performing model show striking similarities with the conventional periodic table of the elements, providing an inspiring example of how machine learning can rediscover, and generalize, intuitive concepts that constitute the foundations of chemistry.},

abstract = {We have calculated the thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) of cubic III-V boron compounds using a predictive first principles approach. Boron arsenide is found to have a remarkable room temperature $\kappa$ over 2000 W m-1 K-1; this is comparable to those in diamond and graphite, which are the highest bulk values known. We trace this behavior in boron arsenide to an interplay of certain basic vibrational properties that lie outside of the conventional guidelines in searching for high $\kappa$ materials, and to relatively weak phonon-isotope scattering. We also find that cubic boron nitride and boron antimonide will have high $\kappa$ with isotopic purification. This work provides new insight into the nature of thermal transport at a quantitative level and predicts a new ultrahigh $\kappa$ material of potential interest for passive cooling applications.},

@article{Callaway1959,
abstract = {A phenomenological model is developed to facilitate calculation of lattice thermal conductivities at low temperatures. It is assumed that the phonon scattering processes can be represented by frequency-dependent relaxation times. Isotropy and absence of dispersion in the crystal vibration spectrum are assumed. No distinction is made between longitudinal and transverse phonons. The assumed scattering mechanisms are (1) point impurities (isotopes), (2) normal three-phonon processes, (3) umklapp processes, and (4) boundary scattering. A special investigation is made of the role of the normal processes which conserve the total crystal momentum and a formula is derived from the Boltzmann equation which gives their contribution to the conductivity. The relaxation time for the normal three-phonon processes is taken to be that calculated by Herring for longitudinal modes in cubic materials. The model predicts for germanium a thermal conductivity roughly proportional to T {\&} in normal material, but proportional to T {\~{}} in single-isotope material in the temperature range 50'—100'K. Magnitudes of the relaxation times are estimated from the experimental data. The thermal conductivity of germanium is calculated by numerical integration for the temperature range 2—100'K. The results are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results for normal and for single-isotope material.},

@article{McGaughey2004,
abstract = {Atomic-level thermal transport is explored using lattice dynamics theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Due to the classical nature of the simulations and the small system sizes considered, a formulation different than the standard quantum-particle based approach is required. This is addressed by using real and phonon space analysis techniques to develop links between the atomic structure of dielectric materials and their thermal conductivities. Crystalline, liquid, and amorphous Lennard-Jones phases, and silica-based crystals (including zeolites) are considered. In predicting the thermal conductivity using the Green-Kubo method (a real space approach), two thermal transport mechanisms are identified. The first is temperature independent, related to short length and time scales, and governed by the atomic coordination. The second is temperature dependent, related to long length and time scales, and typically dominates the thermal transport. In the zeolites, the presence of cage structures, and disorder and anisotropy at sub-unit cell length scales, are found to inhibit the second mechanism, resulting in room temperature thermal conductivities of order 1 W/m-K, an order of magnitude less than that of quartz. The thermal conductivity of the Lennard-Jones crystal is also predicted with the Boltzmann transport equation under the single mode relaxation time approximation. Results from the simulations are used to specify all of the parameters in this phonon space model. Due to the inherent anharmonic nature of the simulations, the inclusion of anharmonic effects is straightforward. By comparing the predictions to those from the Greek-Kubo method, the quantitative validity of this model is established. Prior work required simplifying assumptions and the fitting of the results to experimental data, leading to a masking of the underlying physics. Using unsteady, steady non-equilibrium, and equilibrium simulations, three-phonon interactions are observed. Little attention has previously been given to their description in the MD system. The selection process is found to be governed strictly by the mode wave vectors. In determining the strength of an allowed interaction, consideration must be given to the polarizations and frequencies; the latter in the context of internal resonance.},

Adopting these criteria we obtain curated pseudopotential libraries (named SSSP or standard solid-state pseudopotential libraries), that we target for high-throughput materials screening ("SSSP efficiency") and high-precision materials modelling ("SSSP precision").

abstract = {Understanding the structure and chemical reactivity of water adsorbed at metallic surfaces is very important in many processes such as catalysis, corrosion, and electrochemistry. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigate the adsorption and dissociation of water clusters on flat and stepped surfaces of several transition metals: Rh, Ir, Pd, and Pt. We find that water binds preferentially to the step edges than to terrace sites, thus linear clusters or one-dimensional water wires can be isolated by differential desorption. The clusters formed at the step are stabilized by the cooperative effect of chemical bonds with the metal and hydrogen bonding. The enhanced reactivity of the step edges and the cooperative effect of hydrogen bonding improve the chances of partial dissociation of water clusters. We assess the correlations between adsorption and dissociation energies, observing that they are increased on stepped surfaces. We present a detailed interpretation of water dissociation by analyzing changes in the electronic structure of both water and metals. The identification of trends in the energetics of water dissociation at transition metals is expected to aid the design of better materials for catalysis and fuel cells, where the density of steps at surfaces would be a relevant additional parameter.},

abstract = {The rapid development of faster, cheaper, and more powerful computing has led to some of the most important technological and societal advances in modern history. However, the physical means associated with enhancing computing capabilities at the device and die levels have also created a very challenging set of circumstances for keeping electronic devices cool, a critical factor in determining their speed, efficiency, and reliability. With advances in nanoelectronics and the emergence of new application areas such as three-dimensional chip stack architectures and flexible electronics, now more than ever there are both needs and opportunities for novel materials to help address some of these pressing thermal management challenges. In this paper a number of cubic crystals, two-dimensional layered materials, nanostructure networks and composites, molecular layers and surface functionalization, and aligned polymer structures are examined for potential applications as heat spreading layers and substrates, thermal interface materials, and underfill materials in future-generation electronics. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The frequency/wave-vector dispersion relation for the symmetry directions [00$\zeta$], [0$\zeta$$\zeta$], [$\zeta$$\zeta$$\zeta$], and [0$\zeta$1] in copper at room temperature has been determined by inelastic neutron scattering. Interplanar and atomic force constants have been obtained. First-neighbor interactions are dominant, but longer range forces, extending to at least sixth-nearest neighbors, are also present. Physically realistic errors have been assigned to many of the force constants; to our knowledge this has not been done previously. The analysis of the data, and the excellent agreement between measurements carried out at the Chalk River and McMaster University reactors, indicate that, on the average, the errors conventionally assigned to frequencies in neutron-scattering studies are too large by about a factor of 2 to be standard deviations. Frequency distributions have been obtained and used to calculate various thermodynamic quantities which agree quite well with experiment. (Discrepancies of a few percent appear to be accounted for by anharmonic effects.) Our results are in rather good agreement with those of Sinha obtained by quite different experimental methods.},

abstract = {Crystals and glasses exhibit fundamentally different heat conduction mechanisms: the periodicity of crystals allows for the excitation of propagating vibrational waves that carry heat, as first discussed by Peierls; in glasses, the lack of periodicity breaks Peierls' picture and heat is mainly carried by the coupling of vibrational modes, often described by a harmonic theory introduced by Allen and Feldman. Anharmonicity or disorder are thus the limiting factors for thermal conductivity in crystals or glasses; hitherto, no transport equation has been able to account for both. Here, we derive such equation, resulting in a thermal conductivity that reduces to the Peierls and Allen-Feldman limits, respectively, in anharmonic-and-ordered or harmonic-and-disordered solids, while also covering the intermediate regimes where both effects are relevant. This approach also solves the long-standing problem of accurately predicting the thermal properties of crystals with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity, as we show with an application to a thermoelectric material representative of this class.},

Lett., 103:190601, 2009.) proposed that the quantum statistics of vibrations in condensed systems at low temperature could be simulated by running molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of a colored noise with an appropriate power spectral density. In the present contribution, we show how this method can be implemented in a flexible manner and at a low computational cost by synthesizing the corresponding noise 'on the fly'. The proposed algorithm is tested for a simple harmonic chain as well as for a more realistic model of aluminium crystal. The energy and Debye-Waller factor are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained from harmonic approximations based on the phonon spectrum of the systems. The limitations of the method associated with anharmonic effects are also briefly discussed. Some perspectives for disordered materials and heat transfer are considered.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {High entropy alloy (HEA), a new class of materials, has received attention as a substance that can potentially replace conventional alloys. Equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA is an attractive material with excellent strength-ductility combination and corrosion resistance, and it achieves greater performance in low temperatures. This study investigated the HCF and tensile deformation behavior of equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA. In order to suggest the possibility of the material's application in an as-homogenized state, coarse-grained (CG) equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA was prepared. Microstructural observation measured an average grain size of 245.5 $\mu$m, and it was confirmed to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) random solid solution. A tensile test confirmed that the yield strength and tensile strength are 293.1 MPa and 625.6 MPa, respectively, and change in the work hardening rate according to deformation twin (DT) evolution during tensile deformation was observed. A high-cycle fatigue results shows fatigue strength of 280 MPa, which is close to its yield strength, and this confirmed that the material has outstanding high-cycle fatigue properties considering its yield strength. DT is uniquely formed at cycle loading with a stress level lower than the critical twinning stress ($\sigma$ T ), and this can improve yield strength by approximately 95{\%} and tensile strength by approximately 17{\%}. Based on the above findings, this study discussed the role of DTs which affect the high-cycle fatigue and deformation behavior of coarse-grained HEA.},

abstract = {Intermetallic clathrates are promising candidates for thermoelectric applications. For theoretical investigations of their lattice thermal conductivity, effective potentials for silicon- and germanium-based structures have been developed. To stabilize the fourfold coordinated cage framework, angular dependent potentials are necessary. The phononic properties obtained from these potentials are in good agreement with ab initio calculated and experimental data. Molecular dynamics simulations using the Green-Kubo method are used to calculate the thermal conductivity. Type-I clathrate structures with different degrees of complexity have been studied. The influence of the rattling modes of the guest atoms inside the cages is identified as one source of the low thermal conductivity. However, the vacancies in the host framework also reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of clathrate systems. The results are compared to experimental data where available.},

@article{Nørrelykke2010,
abstract = {Optical tweezers and atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers are often calibrated by fitting their experimental power spectra of Brownian motion. We demonstrate here that if this is done with typical weighted least-squares methods, the result is a bias of relative size between -2/n and +1/n on the value of the fitted diffusion coefficient. Here, n is the number of power spectra averaged over, so typical calibrations contain 10{\%}-20{\%} bias. Both the sign and the size of the bias depend on the weighting scheme applied. Hence, so do length-scale calibrations based on the diffusion coefficient. The fitted value for the characteristic frequency is not affected by this bias. For the AFM then, force measurements are not affected provided an independent length-scale calibration is available. For optical tweezers there is no such luck, since the spring constant is found as the ratio of the characteristic frequency and the diffusion coefficient. We give analytical results for the weight-dependent bias for the wide class of systems whose dynamics is described by a linear (integro)differential equation with additive noise, white or colored. Examples are optical tweezers with hydrodynamic self-interaction and aliasing, calibration of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in finance, models for cell migration in biology, etc. Because the bias takes the form of a simple multiplicative factor on the fitted amplitude (e.g. the diffusion coefficient), it is straightforward to remove and the user will need minimal modifications to his or her favorite least-squares fitting programs. Results are demonstrated and illustrated using synthetic data, so we can compare fits with known true values. We also fit some commonly occurring power spectra once-and-for-all in the sense that we give their parameter values and associated error bars as explicit functions of experimental power-spectral values.},

@article{Kapil2019,
abstract = {Quantitative evaluations of the free energy of materials must take into account thermal and zero-point energy fluctuations. While these effects can easily be estimated within a harmonic approximation, corrections arising from the anharmonic nature of the interatomic potential are often crucial and require computationally costly path integral simulations. Consequently, different approximate frameworks for computing affordable estimates of the anharmonic free energies have been developed over the years. Understanding which of the approximations involved are justified for a given system is complicated by the lack of comparative benchmarks. To facilitate this choice we assess the accuracy and efficiency of some of the commonly used approximate methods -- the vibrational self-consistent field and self-consistent phonons -- by comparing the anharmonic correction to the Helmholtz free energy against reference path integral calculations. These benchmarks are performed for a diverse set of systems, ranging from simple quasi-harmonic solids to flexible molecular crystals with freely-rotating units. Our results suggest that for simple solids such as allotropes of carbon these methods yield results that are in excellent agreement with the reference calculations, at a considerably lower computational cost. For more complex molecular systems such as polymorphs of ice and paracetamol the methods do not consistently provide a reliable approximation of the anharmonic correction. Despite substantial cancellation of errors when comparing the stability of different phases, we do not observe a systematic improvement over the harmonic approximation even for relative free-energies. Our results suggest that efforts towards obtaining computationally-feasible anharmonic free-energies for flexible molecular solids should therefore be directed towards reducing the expense of path integral methods},

PN3 has a skutterudite-like Immm structure and is metastable with positive phonon frequencies at pressures between 10 and 100 GPa. PN3 is metallic and is the first reported nitrogen-based skutterudite. Its metallicity arises from nitrogen p-states which delocalise across N4 rings characteristic of skutterudites, and it becomes a good electron-phonon superconductor at 10 GPa, with a Tc of around 18 K. The superconductivity arises from strongly enhanced electron-phonon coupling at lower pressures, originating primarily from soft collective P-N phonon modes. The PN2 phase is an insulator with P2/m symmetry and is stable at pressures in excess of 200 GPa.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@book{Marx2000,
abstract = {The rapidly growing eld of ab initio molecular dynamics is reviewed in the spirit of a series of lectures given at the Winterschool 2000 at the John von Neumann Institute for Computing, J ulich. Several such molecular dynamics schemes are compared which arise from following various approximations to the fully coupled Schr odinger equation for electrons and nuclei. Special focus is given to the Car Parrinello method with discussion of both strengths and weaknesses in addition to its range of applicability. To shed light upon why the CarParrinello approach works several alternate perspectives of the underlying ideas are presented. The implementation of ab initio molecular dynamics within the framework of plane wavepseudopotential density functional theory is given in detail, including diagonalization and minimization techniques as required for the BornOppenheimer variant. E cient algorithms for the most important computational kernel routines are presented. The adaptation of these routines to distributed memory parallel computers is discussed using the implementation within the computer code CPMD as an example. Several advanced techniques from the eld of molecular dynamics, (constant temperature dynamics, constant pressure dynamics) and electronic structure theory (free energy functional, excited states) are introduced. The combination of the path integral method with ab initio molecular dynamics is presented in detail, showing its limitations and possible extensions. Finally, a wide range of applications from materials science to biochemistry is listed, which shows the enormous potential of ab initio molecular dynamics for both explaining and predicting properties of molecules and materials on an atomic scale.},

We illustrate the applicability of the method by obtaining the anharmonic free energy for the paramagnetic cubic and the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phases of chromium nitride. The influence of lattice dynamics on the transition between the two phases is demonstrated by constructing the temperature-pressure phase diagram.},

The measured phonon densities of states and the infrared spectra showed unusually large energy shifts with temperature, and large linewidth broadenings. First principles molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed at various temperatures, successfully accounting for the negative thermal expansion (NTE) and local dynamics. Using the Fourier-transformed velocity autocorrelation method, the MD calculations reproduced the large anharmonic effects of Ag{\$}{\_}2{\$}O, and were in excellent agreement with the neutron scattering data. The quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) was less successful in accounting for much of the phonon behavior. The QHA could account for some of the NTE below 250 K, although not at higher temperatures. Strong anharmonic effects were found for both phonons and for the NTE. The lifetime broadenings of Ag{\$}{\_}2{\$}O were explained by anharmonic perturbation theory, which showed rich interactions between the Ag-dominated modes and the O-dominated modes in both up- and down-conversion processes.},

However, in this article we show that this anharmonicity has no physical origin and it is a consequence of the deviation of the QHA from the Maxwell relations. We show that one can simply avoid this overestimation by enforcing the QHA method to obey the Maxwell relations throughout the thermodynamically self-consistent (TSC) method, instead of considering non-real local anharmonic effects.},

Simple finite difference equations provide all the necessary terms by at most 6N-11 Hessian evaluations, where N is the number of atoms in the system. Accurate values are obtained by this method using the Becke three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr functional, medium size basis sets, and, when needed, proper treatment of internal rotations. The whole model has been completely automated in the Gaussian package.},

The extensive data set overcomes the difficulties encountered by traditional fitting approaches when using rich and complex analytic forms, allowing to construct potentials with a degree of accuracy comparable to that obtained by ab initio methods. A glue potential for aluminum obtained with this method is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Despite significant advances in computational materials science, a quantitative, parameter-free prediction of the mechanical properties of alloys has been difficult to achieve from first principles. Here, we present a new analytic theory that, with input from first-principles calculations, is able to predict the strengthening of aluminium by substitutional solute atoms. Solute-dislocation interaction energies in and around the dislocation core are first calculated using density functional theory and a flexible-boundary-condition method. An analytic model for the strength, or stress to move a dislocation, owing to the random field of solutes, is then presented. The theory, which has no adjustable parameters and is extendable to other metallic alloys, predicts both the energy barriers to dislocation motion and the zero-temperature flow stress, allowing for predictions of finite-temperature flow stresses. Quantitative comparisons with experimental flow stresses at temperature T=78 K are made for Al-X alloys (X=Mg, Si, Cu, Cr) and good agreement is obtained.},

The scheme combines classical electrostatics with the dielectric profile and the electrostatic potential extracted from the electronic-structure calculation. Spurious electrostatic interactions are removed while retaining the dielectric and quantum-mechanical features of the system of interest, which may have no interface (bulk), a single interface or surface, or two interfaces. A pertinent extrapolation scheme validates the proposed corrections. Applications to the charged Cl vacancy at the surface of NaCl and to the dangling bond at the Si(100) surface show that the corrected formation energies are largely independent of the supercell dimensions and of the size of the vacuum region.},

We show that the general exchange formula has an anisotropiclike term even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and that this term is large, for instance, for collinear configuration in bcc Fe, whereas for fcc Ni it is quite small. We demonstrate that keeping this term leads to what one should consider a biquadratic effective spin Hamiltonian even in the case of collinear arrangement. In noncollinear systems this term results in new tensor elements that are important for exchange interactions at finite temperatures, but they have less importance at low temperature. To illustrate our results in practice, we calculate for bcc Fe magnon spectra obtained from configuration-dependent exchange parameters, where the configurations are determined by finite-temperature effects. Our theory results in the same quantitative results as the finite-temperature neutron scattering experiments.},

abstract = {The understanding of how classical dynamics can emerge in closed quantum systems is a problem of fundamental importance. Remarkably, while classical behavior usually arises from coupling to thermal fluctuations or random spectral noise, it may also be an innate property of certain isolated, periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we experimentally realize the simplest such system, consisting of two coupled, kicked quantum rotors, by subjecting a coherent atomic matter wave to two periodically pulsed, incommensurate optical lattices. Momentum transport in this system is found to be radically different from that in a single kicked rotor, with a breakdown of dynamical localization and the emergence of classical diffusion. Our observation, which confirms a long-standing prediction for many-dimensional quantum-chaotic systems, sheds new light on the quantum-classical correspondence.},

@article{Perdew1981,
abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

abstract = {A technical review of the physical, mechanical, and metallurgical variables that have influenced performance of Al-Li based alloys over the last 50 years is presented. First, the historic evolution of different alloys is discussed. Then, the microstructural features responsible for different mechanical properties are identified and discussed. The role of alloying additions is discussed. The shortcomings of a 2nd generation Al-Li alloys are introduced and the key alloy design principles used to overcome these are discussed. Finally, the performance parameters that play a major role in sizing several aircraft and space craft components are reviewed in a chronological perspective and compared with 3rd-generation Al–Li alloys. It is concluded that significant improvements have been made to position Al–Li alloys to enable improved performance of next generation of air and space craft.},

@article{Horvath1984a,
abstract = {Self-diffusion in an $\alpha$-zirconium single crystal was investigated over the temperature range 779 to 1128 K. The measurements were made by simultaneous diffusion of 95Zr and its radioactive daughter 95Nb and by subsequent ion-beam-sputter sectioning (IBS). The activity of 95Zr in each section was determined from the 724 keV $\gamma$ peak using a Ge-Li spectrometer. Gaussian penetration curves were observed. The diffusivities vary in the range between 3.28 × 10−23 m2 s−1 and 1.04 × 10−18 m2 s−1. The present results are compared with previous studies of self-diffusion in $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Zr. The Arrhenius plot of self-diffusion coefficients in $\alpha$-Zr is strongly curved downward. This means that an anomalous behaviour of self-diffusion is observed not only in the $\beta$- but also in the $\alpha$-phase of Zr. Some results on the diffusion of 95Nb in $\alpha$-Zr are reported in an Appendix.},

@article{Li2012,
abstract = {The form of energy termed heat that typically derives from lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons, is usually considered as waste energy and, moreover, deleterious to information processing. However, in this Colloquium, an attempt is made to rebut this common view: By use of tailored models it is demonstrated that phonons can be manipulated similarly to electrons and photons, thus enabling controlled heat transport. Moreover, it is explained that phonons can be put to beneficial use to carry and process information. In the first part ways are presented to control heat transport and to process information for physical systems which are driven by a temperature bias. In particular, a toolkit of familiar electronic analogs for use of phononics is put forward, i.e., phononic devices are described which act as thermal diodes, thermal transistors, thermal logic gates, and thermal memories. These concepts are then put to work to transport, control, and rectify heat in physically realistic nanosystems by devising practical designs of hybrid nanostructures that permit the operation of functional phononic devices; the first experimental realizations are also reported. Next, richer possibilities to manipulate heat flow by use of time-varying thermal bath temperatures or various other external fields are discussed. These give rise to many intriguing phononic nonequilibrium phenomena such as, for example, the directed shuttling of heat, geometrical phase-induced heat pumping, or the phonon Hall effect, which may all find their way into operation with electronic analogs.},

Resolution effects were taken into account in the determination of intrinsic phonon frequencies and linewidths. The results indicate a general softening of the lattice as the temperature is raised, the vibrations of transverse polarization being more strongly affected than those of longitudinal polarization. Even close to the melting point, most phonon lifetimes were sufficiently long to allow the unambiguous observation of one-phonon line profiles.

abstract = {The equilibrium vacancy concentration in nickel was determined from ab initio calculations performed with both generalized gradient approximation and local density approximation up to the melting point. We focus the study on the vacancy formation entropy expressed as a sum of a vibration and an electronic contribution, which were determined from the vibration modes and the electronic densities of states. Applying a method based on the quasi-harmonic approximation, the temperature dependence of the defect formation energy and entropy were calculated. We show that the vibrations of the first shell of atoms around the defect are predominant to the vibration formation entropy. On the other hand, the electronic formation entropy is very sensitive to the exchange-correlation potential used for the calculations. Finally, the vacancy concentration is computed at finite temperature with the calculated values for the defect formation energy and entropy. In order to reconcile point-defects concentration obtained with our calculations and experimental data, we conducted complementary calorimetric measurements of the vacancy concentration in the 1073-1273 K temperature range. Close agreement between theory and experiments at high temperature is achieved if the calculations are performed with the generalized gradient approximation and both vibration and electronic contributions to the formation entropy are taken into account.},

By accurately reproducing the lattice thermal conductivity, we validate the approaches adopted in this work. We, then, compare and contrast PbSe and PbTe, evaluate the importance of the optical phonons to lattice thermal conductivity, and estimate the impacts of nanostructuring and alloying on further reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. The results indicate that (1) the optical phonons are important not only because they directly comprise over 20{\%} of the lattice thermal conductivity but also because they provide strong scattering channels for acoustic phonons, which is crucial for the low thermal conductivity; (2) nanostructures of less than ∼10 nm are needed to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity for pure PbSe and PbTe; and (3) alloying should be a relatively effective way to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity},

The models were tested against data on a wide range of Al-Mg-Si alloys aged at room temperature. The strengthening due to co-clusters is well predicted. The formation of co-clusters was studied in an Al-0.5 at.{\%} Mg-1 at.{\%} Si alloy using three-dimensional atom probe analysis. The results correspond well with the model. It is shown that in general (short-range) order strengthening due to co-clusters will be the main strengthening mechanism in these alloys. Apart from the co-clusters, Si clusters also form, but due to their low enthalpy of formation they contribute little to the strength. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

We show that: (1) the Gibbs H function yields the correct entropy as defined in phenomenological thermodynamics; (2) the Boltzmann H yields an “entropy” that is in error by a nonnegligible amount whenever interparticle forces affect thermodynamic properties; (3) Boltzmann's other interpretation of entropy, S = k log W, is consistent with the Gibbs H, and derivable from it; (4) the Boltzmann H theorem does not constitute a demonstration of the second law for dilute gases; (5) the dynamical invariance of the Gibbs H gives a simple proof of the second law for arbitrary interparticle forces; (6) the second law is a special case of a general requirement for any macroscopic process to be experimentally reproducible. Finally, the “anthropomorphic” nature of entropy, on both the statistical and phenomenological levels, is stressed.},

The approach is based on the description of configurational cluster functions in terms of an orthogonal basis in the multidimensional space of discrete spin variables. The formalism is used to characterize the reduced density matrices (or cluster probability densities) and the free energy functional obtained in the Cluster Variation Method approximation. For the particular representation chosen, the expectation values of the base functions are the commonly used multisite correlation functions. The latter form an independent set of variational parameters for the free energy which, in general, facilitates the minimization procedure. A new interpretation of the Cluster Variation Method as a self-consistency relation on the renormalized cluster energies is also presented.},

Here, a first treasure map for phase-change materials is presented on the basis of a fundamental understanding of the bonding characteristics. This map is spanned by two coordinates that can be calculated just from the composition, and represent the degree of ionicity and the tendency towards hybridization ('covalency') of the bonding. A small magnitude of both quantities is an inherent characteristic of phase-change materials. This coordinate scheme enables a prediction of trends for the physical properties on changing stoichiometry.},

abstract = {When Planck introduced the 1/2 hv term to his 1911 black body equation he showed that there is a residual energy remaining at zero degree K after all thermal energy ceased. Other investigators, including Lamb, Casimir, and Dirac added to this information. Today zero point energy (ZPE) is accepted as an established condition. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the density of the ZPE is given by the gravity constant (G) and the characteristics of its particles are revealed by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Eddies of ZPE particles created by flow around mass bodies reduce the pressure normal to the eddy flow and are responsible for the force of gravity. Helium atoms resonate with ZPE particles at low temperature to produce superfluid helium. High velocity micro vortices of ZPE particles about a basic particle or particles are responsible for electromagnetic forces. The speed of light is the speed of the wave front in the ZPE and its value is a function of the temperature and density of the ZPE.},

abstract = {We present a simple but accurate scheme to compute the thermodynamic properties of crystalline solids in a wide range of pressure and temperature based on ab initio calculations. Compared to the method based on ab initio thermodynamic-integration techniques, our approach can reduce dramatically the number of ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations needed in the calculations of the intrinsic anharmonic effect neglected in the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Taking tungsten as an example, we show that its thermal properties including the linear thermal-expansion coefficient and the equation of state (EOS) at high pressures and temperatures can be calculated accurately. The precise EOS of W for the pressure up to 500 GPa and the temperature up to 10 000 K may serve as a pressure scale. This method may be able to be extended to the study of solid-solid phase transitions of various crystalline solids, including some alloys.},

Upon annealing, the Si2 pillars provide the skeleton for the nanoparticles to evolve in composition, structure, and morphology. We show that they begin as tiny nuclei with a composition close to Mg2Si2Al7 and a minimal mismatch with the aluminum matrix. They subsequently undergo a one-dimensional growth in association with compositional change, becoming elongated particles. During the evolution toward the final Mg5Si6 particles, the compositional change is accompanied by a characteristic structural change. Our study explains the nanoscopic reasons that the alloys make excellent automotive materials.},

abstract = {Metadynamics is a commonly used and successful enhanced sampling method. By the introduction of a history dependent bias which depends on a restricted number of collective variables(CVs) it can explore complex free energy surfaces characterized by several metastable states separated by large free energy barriers. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple yet powerful method for calculating the rates of transition between different metastable states. The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition states or reaction co-ordinates, as long as CVs are known that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space. We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular dynamics runs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The compound Al3Cu2Mg9Si7, is known as the Q-phase and forms as a thermodynamically stable precipitate during aging in the quaternary Al-Cu-Mg-Si system. We perform atomic-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect properties, solute partitioning, and interfacial stability of the Al3Cu2Mg9Si7 (Q) precipitate. We find: (i) simple native point defect (i.e., vacancies and anti-sites) thermodynamics can partially explain the experimentally observed off-stoichiometry, such as the observed variation of compositions, Al3+$\delta$Cu2Mg9-$\delta$Si7 (Mg-deficient and Al-rich) in experiment. (ii) Calculated solute-partitioning energies of common solutes allow us to define general rules for site-preference in the Q-phase in terms of electronic structure and atomic radius. To validate our DFT predictions, we perform atom-probe tomography (APT) experiments for six-different elements (Zn, Ni, Mn, Ti, V, and Zr). The results show that the partitioning behavior of solutes Ni, Zn, and Mn are consistent with DFT predictions, but the transition elements (Ti, V, and Zr), which are anomalously slow diffusers in Al, partition to the Q-phase in constrast to DFT partitioning energies. (iii) For the low energy interface (112¯0)Q//(510)Al observed in needle shaped Q-precipitate, we survey various terminations and orientations and derive a low-energy interfacial structure. We find this low-energy interfacial model has Cu atoms nearest to the interface, which is in agreement with previous literature on Cu interfacial segregation at the Q′//$\alpha$-Al interface. The computed interfacial energy (0.52 J/m2) and the corresponding structure will be useful input to future multi-scale modeling of microstructural evolution.},

Inverse ripening has been observed where smaller precipitate grows at the expense of a larger one. This occurs due to fluxes generated under elastically-strained solute gradients around precipitates that scales with Rr6where R and r are the precipitate radius and the radial coordinate, respectively. Both isotropic and anisotropic dependency of elastic constants on the composition were considered. The latter leads to the emergence of new patterns of elastic anisotropy and rearrangement of precipitates in the matrix.},

It involves preparing the supercell at the time t = 0 in physically correct microstates using the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix. Each initial microstate corresponds to a different distribution of kinetic and potential energies for each vibrational mode (the total energy of each microstate is the same). Averaging the MD runs over many initial microstates further reduces $\Delta$T. The electronic states are obtained using first-principles theory (density-functional theory in periodic supercells). Three applications are discussed: the lifetime and decay of vibrational excitations, the isotope dependence of thermal conductivities, and the flow of heat at an interface.},

abstract = {The self-consistent harmonic approximation is an effective harmonic theory to calculate the free energy of systems with strongly anharmonic atomic vibrations, and its stochastic implementation has proved to be an efficient method to study, from first-principles, the anharmonic properties of solids. The free energy as a function of average atomic positions (centroids) can be used to study quantum or thermal lattice instability. In particular the centroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions such as, e.g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According to Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy (i.e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry configuration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the instability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the second derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic approximation for a generic atomic configuration. The analytic derivative is expressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be evaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling. Our approach is particularly suitable for applications based on first-principles density-functional-theory calculations, where the forces on atoms can be obtained with a negligible computational effort compared to total energy determination. Finally we propose a dynamical extension of the theory to calculate spectral properties of strongly anharmonic phonons, as probed by inelastic scattering processes. We illustrate our method with a numerical application on a toy model that mimics the ferroelectric transition in rock-salt crystals such as SnTe or GeTe.},

abstract = {We investigate the long-wavelength dispersion of longitudinal and transverse optical phonon modes in polar two-dimensional materials, multilayers, and their heterostructures. Using analytical models and density-functional perturbation theory in a two-dimensional framework, we show that these modes are degenerate at zone center but the macroscopic electric field associated with longitudinal-optical modes gives rise to a finite slope in the corresponding phonon dispersion. This slope increases linearly with the number of layers and it is determined solely by the Born effective charges of the material and the dielectric properties of the surrounding media. Screening from the environment can greatly reduce the slope-splitting as in the experimentally relevant case of boron nitride-graphene heterostructures. As the phonon momentum increases, the intrinsic screening properties of the two-dimensional material dictate the transition to a momentum-independent splitting similar to the case of three-dimensional materials.},

This method realizes automatic generation of machine learning force fields on the basis of Bayesian inference during molecular dynamics simulations, where the first principles calculations are only executed, when new configurations out of already sampled datasets appear. The developed method is applied to the calculation of melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO. The applications indicate that more than 99 $\backslash${\%} of the first principles calculations are bypassed during the force field generation. This allows the machine to quickly construct first principles datasets over wide phase spaces. Furthermore, with the help of the generated machine learning force fields, simulations are accelerated by a factor of thousand compared with first principles calculations. Accuracies of the melting points calculated by the force fields are examined by thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the examination indicates that the machine learning force fields can quantitatively reproduce the first principles melting points.},

abstract = {We use first-principles techniques to re-examine the suggestion that transitions seen in high-P experiments on Mo are solid-solid transitions from the bcc structure to either the fcc or hcp structures. We confirm that in the harmonic approximation the free energies of fcc and hcp structures become lower than that of bcc at P {\textgreater} 325 GPa and T below the melting curve, as reported recently. However, we show that if anharmonic effects are fully included this is no longer true. We calculate fully anharmonic free energies of high-T crystal phases by integration of the thermal average stress with respect to strain as structures are deformed into each other, and also by thermodynamic integration from harmonic reference systems to the fully anharmonic system. Our finding that fcc is thermodynamically less stable than bcc in the relevant high-P/high-T region is supported by comparing the melting curves of the two structures calculated using the first-principles reference-coexistence technique. We present first-principles simulations based on the recently proposed Z method which also support the stability of bcc over fcc.},

abstract = {A self-consistent variational method is used to approximate the thermodynamic functions of anharmonic crystals. It is shown that for an arbitrary lattice potential, the entropy is given correctly within the variational approximation by the harmonic theory (S H ) with the harmonic frequencies replaced by the self-consistent renormalized frequencies Omega q (T). This simple replacement is not valid for other thermodynamic functions. The specific heats at constant pressure (C p ) or constant volume (C v ) are shown to be simple functions depending only on Omega q (P,T) or Omega q (V,T), which can be calculated from a model of the lattice potential. Several one-dimensional model potentials are used to illustrate the calculations of specific heats from this approach. A test is also presented of the proposition that the measured phonon frequencies give a good approximation to the exact thermodynamics when used to calculate the entropy via the harmonic formula for Nb.},

abstract = {High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a new class of random alloys having impressive strength and toughness. Here, a mechanistic, parameter-free, and predictive theory for the temperature-, composition-, and strain-rate-dependence of the plastic yield strength of fcc HEAs is presented, validated, and applied to understand recent experiments. To first order, each elemental component in the HEA is considered as a solute embedded in the effective matrix of the surrounding alloy. Strengthening is then mainly achieved due to dislocation interactions with the random local concentration fluctuations around the average composition. The theory is validated against molecular simulations on model Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Hall-Petch-corrected yield strengths in Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Mn fcc HEAs are then predicted using only available experimental information, and good quantitative agreement is achieved. The theory demonstrates the origins of the high strength and detailed trends with composition, materials parameters, temperature, thus identifying the key measurable/calculable material properties needed for design and optimization of fcc HEAs, and is a general model for fcc random alloys.},

At pressures above 225 gigapascals and temperatures over 3400 kelvin, Fe(0.9)Ni(0.1) adopts a body-centered cubic structure. Our experimental and theoretical results not only support the interpretation of shockwave data on pure iron as showing a solid-solid phase transition above about 200 gigapascals, but also suggest that iron alloys with geochemically reasonable compositions (that is, with substantial nickel, sulfur, or silicon content) adopt the bcc structure in Earth's inner core.},

abstract = {Anomalies often occur in the physical world. Sometimes quite unexpectedly anomalies may give rise to new insight to an unrecognized phenomenon. In this paper we shall discuss about Kohn anomaly in a conventional phonon-driven superconductor by using a microscopic approach. Recently Aynajian et al.'s experiment showed a striking feature; the energy of phonon at a particular wave-vector is almost exactly equal to twice the energy of the superconducting gap. Although the phonon mechanism of superconductivity is well known for many conventional superconductors, as has been noted by Scalapino, the new experimental results reveal a genuine puzzle. In our recent work we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis with the help of microscopic calculations to unravel this mystery. We probe this aspect of phonon behaviour from the properties of electronic polarizability function in the superconducting phase of a Fermi liquid metal, leading to the appearance of a Kohn singularity. We show the crossover to the standard Kohn anomaly of the normal phase for temperatures above the transition temperature. Our analysis provides a nearly complete explanation of this new experimentally discovered phenomenon. This report is a shorter version of our recent work in JPCM. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermal spray processes are widely used for the manufacture of advanced coating systems, e.g. metallic coatings for wear and corrosion protection. The desired coating properties are closely related to the microstructure, which is highly influenced by the processing parameters, such as temperature, size and velocity of the sprayed particles. In this paper, large scale Molecular Dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate the microstructure formation mechanisms during the spraying process of hot nano-particles onto a substrate at room temperature using pure copper as a benchmark material representing for a wider class of face-centered-cubic metals. To evaluate the influence of processing parameters on the coating morphology, a number of simulations are performed in which the initial temperature, size and velocity of copper particles are systematically varied in order to investigate the thermal and microstructural evolution during impaction. Two distinct types of microstructural formation mechanisms, resulting in different coating morphologies, are observed in the present investigation, which are either governed by plastic deformation or by the process of melting and subsequent solidification. Furthermore, a thermodynamically motivated model as a function of the particle temperature and velocity is developed, which predicts the microstructural mechanisms observed in the simulations. The results provide an elementary insight into the microstructure formation mechanisms on an atomistic scale, which can serve as basic input for continuum modeling of thermal spray process.},

@article{Protik2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society.Using a first principles theoretical approach, we show that vacancies give anomalously strong suppression of the lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of cubic Boron arsenide (BAs), which has recently been predicted to have an exceptionally high $\kappa$. This effect is tied to the unusually large phonon lifetimes in BAs and results in a stronger reduction in the BAs $\kappa$ than occurs in diamond. The large changes in bonding around vacancies cannot be accurately captured using standard perturbative methods and are instead treated here using an ab initio Green function approach. As and B vacancies are found to have similar effects on $\kappa$. In contrast, we show that commonly used mass disorder models for vacancies fail for large mass ratio compounds such as BAs, incorrectly predicting much stronger (weaker) phonon scattering when the vacancy is on the heavy (light) atom site. The quantitative treatment given here contributes to fundamental understanding of the effect of point defects on thermal transport in solids and provides guidance to synthesis efforts to grow high quality BAs.},

abstract = {Zr and Sc precipitate in aluminum alloys to form the compounds Al3Zr and Al3Sc which for low supersaturations of the solid solution have the L12 structure. The aim of the present study is to model at an atomic scale this kinetics of precipitation and to build a mesoscopic model based on classical nucleation theory so as to extend the field of supersaturations and annealing times that can be simulated. We use some ab-initio calculations and experimental data to fit an Ising model describing thermodynamics of the Al-Zr and Al-Sc systems. Kinetic behavior is described by means of an atom-vacancy exchange mechanism. This allows us to simulate with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm kinetics of precipitation of Al3Zr and Al3Sc. These kinetics are then used to test the classical nucleation theory. In this purpose, we deduce from our atomic model an isotropic interface free energy which is consistent with the one deduced from experimental kinetics and a nucleation free energy. We test di erent mean-field approximations (Bragg-Williams approximation as well as Cluster Variation Method) for these parameters. The classical nucleation theory is coherent with the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations only when CVM is used: it manages to reproduce the cluster size distribution in the metastable solid solution and its evolution as well as the steady-state nucleation rate. We also find that the capillary approximation used in the classical nucleation theory works surprisingly well when compared to a direct calculation of the free energy of formation for small L12 clusters.},

@article{Errea2016,
abstract = {The quantum nature of the proton can crucially affect the structural and physical properties of hydrogen compounds. For example, in the high-pressure phases of H2O, quantum proton fluctuations lead to symmetrization of the hydrogen bond and reduce the boundary between asymmetric and symmetric structures in the phase diagram by 30 gigapascals (ref. 3). Here we show that an analogous quantum symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals-the highest Tc reported for any superconductor so far. Superconductivity occurs via the formation of a compound with chemical formula H3S (sulfur trihydride) with sulfur atoms arranged on a body-centred cubic lattice. If the hydrogen atoms are treated as classical particles, then for pressures greater than about 175 gigapascals they are predicted to sit exactly halfway between two sulfur atoms in a structure with symmetry. At lower pressures, the hydrogen atoms move to an off-centre position, forming a short H-S covalent bond and a longer H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}S hydrogen bond in a structure with R3m symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the H3S stoichiometry and the sulfur lattice sites, but were unable to discriminate between the two phases. Ab initio density-functional-theory calculations show that quantum nuclear motion lowers the symmetrization pressure by 72 gigapascals for H3S and by 60 gigapascals for D3S. Consequently, we predict that the phase dominates the pressure range within which the high Tc was measured. The observed pressure dependence of Tc is accurately reproduced in our calculations for the phase, but not for the R3m phase. Therefore, the quantum nature of the proton fundamentally changes the superconducting phase diagram of H3S.},

abstract = {The storage of electrical energy at high charge and discharge rate is an important technology in today's society, and can enable hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and provide back-up for wind and solar energy. It is typically believed that in electrochemical systems very high power rates can only be achieved with supercapacitors, which trade high power for low energy density as they only store energy by surface adsorption reactions of charged species on an electrode material. Here we show that batteries which obtain high energy density by storing charge in the bulk of a material can also achieve ultrahigh discharge rates, comparable to those of supercapacitors. We realize this in LiFePO(4) (ref. 6), a material with high lithium bulk mobility, by creating a fast ion-conducting surface phase through controlled off-stoichiometry. A rate capability equivalent to full battery discharge in 10-20 s can be achieved.},

In the adiabatic approximation, this includes transverse and longitudinal magnetic excitation spectra on equal footing. The exchange interaction parameters of the Hamiltonian for bcc Fe and fcc Ni are determined from constrained local spin-density approximation calculations. Finite temperature magnetic properties of the resulting model Hamiltonian are then investigated by a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The calculated Curie temperatures and paramagnetic susceptibilities are in good agreement with experimental data for both metals.

abstract = {Heat dissipation is an increasingly critical technological challenge in modern electronics and photonics as devices continue to shrink to the nanoscale. To address this challenge, high thermal conductivity materials that can efficiently dissipate heat from hot spots and improve device performance are urgently needed. Boron phosphide is a unique high thermal conductivity and refractory material with exceptional chemical inertness, hardness, and high thermal stability, which holds high promises for many practical applications. So far, however, challenges with boron phosphide synthesis and characterization have hampered the understanding of its fundamental properties and potential applications. Here, we describe a systematic thermal transport study based on a synergistic synthesis-experimental-modeling approach: we have chemically synthesized high-quality boron phosphide single crystals and measured their thermal conductivity as a record-high 460 W/mK at room temperature. Through nanoscale ballistic transport, we have, for the first time, mapped the phonon spectra of boron phosphide and experimentally measured its phonon mean free-path spectra with consideration of both natural and isotope-pure abundances. We have also measured the temperature- and size-dependent thermal conductivity and performed corresponding calculations by solving the three-dimensional and spectral-dependent phonon Boltzmann transport equation using the variance-reduced Monte Carlo method. The experimental results are in good agreement with that predicted by multiscale simulations and density functional theory, which together quantify the heat conduction through the phonon mode dependent scattering process. Our finding underscores the promise of boron phosphide as a high thermal conductivity material for a wide range of applications, including thermal management and energy regulation, and provides a detailed, microscopic-level understanding of the phonon spectra and thermal transport mechanisms of boron phosphide. The present study paves the way toward the establishment of a new framework, based on the phonon spectra–material structure relationship, for the rational design of high thermal conductivity materials and nano- to multiscale devices.},

The training database includes total energies, forces, and stresses obtained from density-functional theory in the generalized-gradient approximation, and comprises approximately 150,000 local atomic environments, ranging from pristine and defected bulk configurations to surfaces and generalized stacking faults with different crystallographic orientations. We find the structural, vibrational and thermodynamic properties of the GAP model to be in excellent agreement with those obtained directly from first-principles electronic-structure calculations. There is good transferability to quantities, such as Peierls energy barriers, which are determined to a large extent by atomic configurations that were not part of the training set. We observe the benefit and the need of using highly converged electronic-structure calculations to sample a target potential energy surface. The end result is a systematically improvable potential that can achieve the same accuracy of density-functional theory calculations, but at a fraction of the computational cost.},

The computational efficiency of the potential allows one to access large time and length scales through molecular dynamics simulations. The use of active learning and an automatic training procedure greatly reduces the number of quantum-mechanical calculations for the training set. In order to estimate the accuracy of the obtained potentials, four materials Al, Mo, Ti and U with different phonon and thermodynamic properties were investigated. Phonon properties were calculated using the temperature dependent effective potential method. The potentials reproduce not only harmonic behavior but also anharmonic effects, as shown by the calculation of the third-order force constants. We found that machine-learning potentials reproduce quantum-mechanical data with high accuracy. Furthermore, the vibrational density of states was obtained via velocity autocorrelation function integration, which would be infeasible in direct quantum-mechanical simulations.},

By using transmission electron microscopy and nanomechanical characterization, we report that the intense hardening effect of dilute oxygen solutes in pure a-Ti is due to the interaction between oxygen and the core of screw dislocations that mainly glide on prismatic planes. First-principles calculations reveal that distortion of the interstitial sites at the screw dislocation core creates a very strong but short-range repulsion for oxygen that is consistent with experimental observations.These results establish a highly effectivemechanism for strengthening by interstitial solutes},

In constructing the PES, a variety of properties of the elements were considered, including lattice dynamics,mechanical properties, thermal behavior, energetics of competing crystal structures, defects, deformation paths, liquid structures, and so forth. For each element, the constructed EAM potentials were tested against the experiment data pertaining to thermal expansion, melting, and liquid dynamics via molecular dynamics computer simulation. The as-developed potentials demonstrate high fidelity and robustness. Owing to their improved accuracy and wide applicability, the potentials are suitable for high-quality atomistic computer simulation of practical applications.},

abstract = {For the fcc metals Cu, Ag, Au, and Al, a theoretical analysis has been made of the one-phonon linewidth due to cubic anharmonic interactions. Third-order central and angular force constants have been obtained by using the symmetry properties of the lattice to relate the force constants with the experimental third-order elastic moduli. The convergence of the value of the nearest-neighbor third-order force constant has been studied as a function of the range of the cubic interactions. We have found that for metals for which the third-order Cauchy relations are violated it is necessary to introduce cubic angular forces to obtain a convergent value of the nearest-neighbor force constant. For Al and Cu the evaluated linewidths are compared with experimental data.},

abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a prototype molecular system and a sister molecule of water (H2O). The phase diagram of solid H2S at high pressures remains largely unexplored arising from the challenges in dealing with the pressure-induced weakening of S-H bond and larger atomic core difference between H and S. Metallization is yet achieved for H2O, but it was observed for H2S above 96 GPa. However, the metallic structure of H2S remains elusive, greatly impeding the understanding of its metallicity and the potential superconductivity. We have performed an extensive structural study on solid H2S at pressure ranges of 10-200 GPa through an unbiased structure prediction method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. Besides the findings of candidate structures for nonmetallic phases IV and V, we are able to establish stable metallic structures violating an earlier proposal of elemental decomposition into sulfur and hydrogen [R. Rousseau, M. Boero, M. Bernasconi, M. Parrinello, and K. Terakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1254 (2000)]. Our study unravels a superconductive potential of metallic H2S with an estimated maximal transition temperature of ∼80 K at 160 GPa, higher than those predicted for most archetypal hydrogen-containing compounds (e.g., SiH4, GeH4, etc.).},

@article{Werinos2016,
abstract = {This study presents a design strategy for Al–Mg–Si alloys to control natural aging. Recently, trace addition of Sn was shown to suppress natural aging for up to two weeks, which was explained by the strong trapping of vacancies to Sn atoms. Here we explore the effect of solution treatment temperature, the combination of trace elements such as Sn and In, and the composition of main hardening elements Mg, Si and Cu on natural aging. The results are discussed based on the dissolvable amount of trace elements and their effect on diffusion retardation, and solute clustering mechanisms in Al–Mg–Si alloys. Thermodynamic calculations using the CALPHAD approach show that maximum retardation of natural aging is achievable at the highest trace element solubility, which exists at significantly different solution treatment temperatures for Sn or In. The effects of Mg, Si and Cu content on natural aging kinetics are interpreted via their influence on the Sn solubility and clustering mechanisms. It is proposed that Sn additions reduce the concentration of excess vacancies, which is most important for early Si clustering, and that the effect of Cu is comparable to the effect of Sn, but less pronounced. Based on the investigated parameter space, a design concept is proposed and an Al–Mg–Si alloy showing suppression of natural aging for {\textgreater}6 months and significant artificial aging potential is demonstrated.},

In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of -';.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic lelds are also treated by similar methods.

Acoustic and flexure modes with mean free paths of the order of a few microns are identified as major contributors to the high value of SWCNT conductivity. We also find that the interaction with an external medium may substantially decrease the lifetime of the low-frequency vibrations, reducing the thermal conductivity by up to 2 orders of magnitude.},

@article{Chen2015,
abstract = {Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) is a popular sampling method in the molecular simulation. By frequently exchanging the replicas at different temperatures, the molecule can jump out of the minima and sample efficiently in the conformational space. Although REMD has been shown to be practical in a lot of applications, it does have a critical limitation. All the replicas at all the temperatures must be simulated for a period between the replica-exchange steps. This may be problematic for the reaction with high free energy barriers. In that case, too many replicas are required in the simulation. To reduce the calculation quantity and improve its performance, in this paper we propose a modified REMD method. During the simulation, each replica at each temperature can stay in either the active or inactive state and only switch between the states at the exchange step. In the active state, the replica moves freely in the canonical ensemble by the normal molecular dynamics, and in the inactive state, the replica is frozen temporarily until the next exchange step. The number of the replicas in the active states (active replicas) depends on the number of CPUs in the computer. Using the additional inactive replicas, one can perform an REMD simulation in a wider temperature space. The practical applications show that the modified REMD method is reliable. With the same number of active replicas, this REMD method can produce a more reasonable free energy surface around the free energy minima than the standard REMD method.},

Optimization of the potential parameters to a well-converged set of density-functional theory (DFT) forces, energies, and stresses produces a reliable and transferable potential for molecular dynamics simulations. The potential accurately describes properties related to the fitting data, and also produces excellent results for quantities outside the fitting range. Structural and elastic properties, defect energetics, and thermal behavior compare well with DFT results and experimental data, e.g., DFT surface energies are reproduced with less than 4{\%} error, generalized stacking-fault energies differ from DFT values by less than 15{\%}, and the melting temperature is within 2{\%} of the experimental value.},

Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure.

MTPs are able to actively select configurations and parametrize the potential on-the-fly. It is shown that MTPs accurately reproduce energies, forces and stresses calculated ab initio. As a more comprehensive test, MTPs are employed to calculate vacancy diffusion rates in Al, Mo and Si. We demonstrate that the results are in a good agreement with ab initio data for the materials considered.},

abstract = {The discovery of nanostructures and the development of growth and fabrication techniques of one- and two-dimensional materials provide the possibility to probe experimentally heat transport in low-dimensional systems. Nevertheless measuring the thermal conductivity of these systems is extremely challenging and subject to large uncertainties, thus hindering the chance for a direct comparison between experiments and statistical physics models. Atomistic simulations of realistic nanostructures provide the ideal bridge between abstract models and experiments. After briefly introducing the state of the art of heat transport measurement in nanostructures, and numerical techniques to simulate realistic systems at atomistic level, we review the contribution of lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics simulation to understanding nanoscale thermal transport in systems with reduced dimensionality. We focus on the effect of dimensionality in determining the phononic properties of carbon and semiconducting nanostructures, specifically considering the cases of carbon nanotubes, graphene and of silicon nanowires and ultra-thin membranes, underlying analogies and differences with abstract lattice models.},

@article{Pozzo2012,
abstract = {The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat flux depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles--unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core.},

abstract = {Random solid solution alloys are a broad class of materials that are used across the entire spectrum of engineering metals, whether as stand-alone materials (e.g. Al-5xxx alloys) or as the matrix in precipitate-strengthening materials (e.g. Ni-based superalloys). As a result, the mechanisms of, and prediction of, strengthening in solid solutions has a long history. Many concepts have been developed and important trends identified but predictive capability has remained elusive. In recent years, a new theory has been developed that builds on one historical model, the Labusch model, in important ways that lead to a well-defined model valid for random solutions with arbitrary numbers of components and compositions. The new theory uses first-principles-computed solute/dislocation interaction energies as input, from which specific predictions emerge for the yield strength and activation volume as a function of alloy composition, temperature, and strain-rate. Being a general model for materials that otherwise have a low Peierls stress, it has broad application and has been successfully applied to Al-X alloys, Mg-Al, twinning in Mg alloys, and recently fcc High-Entropy Alloys. Here, the new theory is presented in a general and systematic manner. Approximations and limiting cases that reduce the complexity and facilitate understanding are introduced, and help relate the new model to various physical features present among the historical array of models, other recent models, and simulation studies. The quantitative predictions of the model in the various materials above is then demonstrated.},

Although these potentials have a many-body nature, a pairwise force expression that follows Newton's third law can be found without referring to any partition of the potential. Based on this force formula, a stress applicable for periodic systems can be unambiguously defined. The force formula can then be used to derive the heat current formulas using a natural potential partitioning. Our heat current formulation is found to be equivalent to most of the seemingly different heat current formulas used in the literature, but to deviate from the stress-based formula derived from two-body potential. We validate our formulation numerically on various systems descried by the Tersoff potential, namely three-dimensional silicon and diamond, two-dimensional graphene, and quasi-one-dimensional carbon nanotube. The effects of cell size and time used in the simulation are examined.},

abstract = {The accuracy of the results obtained in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations crucially depends on a reliable description of the atomic interactions. A large variety of efficient potentials has been proposed in the literature, but often the optimum functional form is difficult to find and strongly depends on the particular system. In recent years, artificial neural networks (NN) have become a promising new method to construct potentials for a wide range of systems. They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method. Significant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications demonstrate the capabilities of neural network potentials. In this Perspective, the current status of NN potentials is reviewed, and their advantages and limitations are discussed.},

abstract = {Harmonic calculations based on density-functional theory are generally the method of choice for the description of phonon spectra of metals and insulators. The inclusion of anharmonic effects is, however, delicate as it relies on perturbation theory requiring a considerable amount of computer time, fast increasing with the cell size. Furthermore, perturbation theory breaks down when the harmonic solution is dynamically unstable or the anharmonic correction of the phonon energies is larger than the harmonic frequencies themselves. We present here a stochastic implementation of the self-consistent harmonic approximation valid to treat anharmonicity at any temperature in the nonperturbative regime. The method is based on the minimization of the free energy with respect to a trial density matrix described by an arbitrary harmonic Hamiltonian. The minimization is performed with respect to all the free parameters in the trial harmonic Hamiltonian, namely, equilibrium positions, phonon frequencies, and polarization vectors. The gradient of the free energy is calculated following a stochastic procedure. The method can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties, dynamical properties, and even anharmonic corrections to the Eliashberg function of the electron-phonon coupling. The scaling with the system size is greatly improved with respect to perturbation theory. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the strongly anharmonic palladium and platinum hydrides. In both cases, we predict a strong anharmonic correction to the harmonic phonon spectra, far beyond the perturbative limit. In palladium hydrides, we calculate thermodynamic properties beyond the quasiharmonic approximation, while in PtH, we demonstrate that the high superconducting critical temperatures at 100 GPa predicted in previous calculations based on the harmonic approximation are strongly suppressed when anharmonic effects are included.},

It is shown that the relative frequency shifts and the phonon damping near melting do not exceed 10-20{\%}. The relative role of various anharmonic processes is examined, and the relation between the results obtained and existing experimental data is discussed.},

The result is discussed in terms of low-order explicitly anharmonic phonon frequency shifts $\Delta$3+$\Delta$4 and shifts $\Delta$2 due to the thermal expansion. The total shift in $\Theta$S ($\Delta$2+$\Delta$3+$\Delta$4+higher-order terms) is very similar for all the metals. At Tm it lies between -0.10$\Theta$S and -0.15$\Theta$S except for Li (-0.08$\Theta$S). ($\Delta$3+$\Delta$4)/$\Delta$2 typically ranges from -0.4 to + 0.6. Higher-order anharmonic shifts are found to be small, decreasing $\Theta$S by 1 to 3{\%} at Tm. Accurate values are derived for some frequency moments of the harmonic (i.e., low-temperature) phonon density of states.},

abstract = {The mobility of vacancies in alloys may limit dislocation climb. Using a combined density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo approach we investigate vacancy diffusion in Ni-Re, Ni-W, and Ni-Ta binary alloys up to 10 at.{\%} solute concentration. We introduce an interaction model that takes into account the chemical environment close to the diffusing atom to capture the effect of solute-host and solute-solute interactions on the diffusion barriers. In contrast to an ideal solid solution, it is not only the diffusion barrier of the solute atom that influences the vacancy mobility, but primarily the change in the host diffusion barriers due to the presence of solute atoms. This is evidenced by the fact that the observed vacancy slowdown as a function of solute concentration is larger in Ni-W than in Ni-Re, even though Re is a slower diffuser than W. To model diffusion in complex, nondilute alloys, an explicit treatment of interaction energies is thus unavoidable. In the context of Ni-based superalloys, two conclusions can be drawn from our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations: the observed slowdown in vacancy mobility is not sufficient to be the sole cause for the so-called Re effect, and assuming a direct correlation between vacancy mobility, dislocation climb, and creep strength, the experimentally observed similar effect of W and Re in enhancing creep strength can be confirmed.},

@article{DeFontaine1971,
abstract = {The omega phase is shown experimentally to be formed by cooling certain metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys to cryogenic temperatures. The transformation is completely reversible and is characterized by a small temperature hysteresis. The diffusionless hexagonal $\omega$ phase so formed is of the same composition as the parent b.c.c. $\beta$ phase, and the gradual progression from diffuse streaking in the diffraction patterns of the $\beta$ phase to the sharp $\omega$ reflections is interpreted in terms of a displacive type reaction. Computer generated plots of the elastic energy of harmonic displacement waves in the b.c.c. lattice are shown to reproduce many of the features of the diffuse intensity in the electron diffraction patterns. The complex quasi-circular streaks observed in some zone patterns are shown to result from the planar intersection of spherical surfaces of intensity in reciprocal space. It is suggested that the progressive transition from circular to rectilinear streaks correspond to a decreased coupling between {\{}111{\}} displacement modes responsible for the diffuse intensity. At sufficiently low temperatures, the diffuse streaks, which lie close to traces of {\{}111{\}} planes, contain sharp intensity peaks at positions 1 3〈112〉, characteristic of the $\omega$ phase. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {The phonon spectrum of the high-pressure simple cubic phase of calcium, in the harmonic approximation, shows imaginary branches that make it mechanically unstable. In this Letter, the phonon spectrum is recalculated by using density-functional theory ab initio methods fully including anharmonic effects up to fourth order at 50 GPa. Considering that the perturbation theory cannot be employed with imaginary harmonic frequencies, a variational procedure based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality is used to estimate the renormalized phonon frequencies. The results show that strong quantum anharmonic effects make the imaginary phonons become positive even at zero temperature so that the simple cubic phase becomes mechanically stable, as experiments suggest. Moreover, our calculations find a superconducting T(c) in agreement with experiments and predict an anomalous behavior of the specific heat.},

@article{Petry1995,
abstract = {The phonon dispersion of the high temperature bcc phase of the group 3 and 4 metals is characterised by a valley of low energy and strongly damped transverse phonons. The large fluctuations in amplitude related to these phonons probe the lattice potential for displacements towards the close packed product phases into which these materials tend to transform. At the same time they stabilize the open bcc structure via their dominating contribution to the lattice entropy. In pure monoatomic metals these precursors are of purely dynamical nature, only the introduction of defects leads to a static condensation of the displacements. Because the trajectory for the displacive transformation and the elementary jump for self diffusion in these metals point in the same direction, the height of the migration barrier and the tendency of the bcc metals to transform are related to each other. Whereas, for the bcc to close packed transition shuffles and homogenous strains involved in the transition could be identified, such an assignment was not possible for the inverse transition, nor for transitions from close packed to close packed structures},

We present a new approach to the systematic approximation of the first-principles potential energy surface (PES) of molecular liquids using the GAP (Gaussian Approximation Potential) framework. The approach allows us to create potentials at several different levels of accuracy in reproducing the true PES, which allows us to test the level of quantum chemistry that is necessary to accurately predict its macroscopic properties. We test the approach by building potentials for liquid methane (CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}), which is difficult to model from first principles because its behavior is dominated by weak dispersion interactions with a significant many-body component. We find that an accurate, consistent prediction of its bulk density across a wide range of temperature and pressure requires not only many-body dispersion, but also quantum nuclear effects to be modeled accurately.},

After an overview of basic ideas and a reminder of the importance of measurement, the author considers in turn gases, solids, liquids, and phase changes. For each topic, the focus is on "what happens." After a preliminary examination of data on the properties of matter, the author raises, then addresses a series of questions concerning the data. It is only in answering these questions that he adopts the theoretical approach to the properties of matter. This approach can reawaken in readers the fascination for the subject that inspired some of the greatest physicists of our age. Examples and extensive exercises reinforce the concepts.

Discovery of materials with very low or high {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} remains an experimental challenge due to high costs and time-consuming synthesis procedures. High-throughput computational pre-screening is a valuable approach for significantly reducing the set of candidate compounds. In this article, we introduce efficient methods for reliably estimating the bulk {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} for a large number of compounds. The algorithms are based on a combination of machine-learning algorithms, physical insights, and automatic ab-initio calculations. We scanned approximately 79,000 half-Heusler entries in the AFLOWLIB.org database. Among the 450 mechanically stable ordered semiconductors identified, we find that {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} spans more than two orders of magnitude- a much larger range than that previously thought. {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} is lowest for compounds whose elements in equivalent positions have large atomic radii. We then perform a thorough screening of thermodynamical stability that allows to reduce the list to 77 systems. We can then provide a quantitative estimate of {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} for this selected range of systems. Three semiconductors having {\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$omega{\}} {\textless} 5 W /(m K) are proposed for further experimental study.},

abstract = {As chromium is a decisive ingredient for stainless steels, a reliable understanding of its thermodynamic properties is indispensable. Parameter-free first-principles methods have nowadays evolved to a state allowing such thermodynamic predictions. For materials such as Cr, however, the inclusion of magnetic entropy and higher order contributions such as anharmonic entropy is still a formidable task. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and statistical concepts, we compute a set of thermodynamic properties based on quasiharmonic, anharmonic, electronic and magnetic free energy contributions from first principles. The magnetic contribution is modeled by an effective nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, which itself is solved numerically exactly by means of a quantum Monte Carlo method. We investigate two different scenarios: a weak magnetic coupling scenario for Cr, as usually presumed in empirical thermodynamic models, turns out to be in clear disagreement with experimental observations. We show that instead a mixed Hamiltonian including weak and strong magnetic coupling provides a consistent picture with good agreement to experimental thermodynamic data.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional materials have unusual phonon structures due to the presence of flexural (out-of-plane) modes. Although molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study heat transport in such materials, conventional formalisms treat the phonon dynamics isotropically. Here, we decompose the microscopic heat current in atomistic simulations into in-plane and out-of-plane components, corresponding to the in-plane and out-of-plane phonon dynamics, respectively. This decomposition allows for direct computation of the corresponding thermal conductivity components in two-dimensional materials. We apply this decomposition to study heat transport in suspended graphene, using both equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the flexural component is responsible for about two thirds of the total thermal conductivity in unstrained graphene, and the acoustic flexural component is responsible for the logarithmic divergence of the conductivity when a sufficiently large tensile strain is applied.},

A 50{\%} increase in thermal conductivity for isotopically pure boron ((11)B) nitride nanotubes was recently measured, but the reason for this enhancement remains unclear. To address this issue, we examine thermal transport through boron nitride nanotubes using an atomistic Green's function transport formalism coupled with phonon properties calculated from density functional theory. We develop an independent scatterer model for (10)B defects to account for phonon isotope scattering found in natural boron nitride nanotubes. Phonon scattering from (10)B dramatically reduces phonon transport at higher frequencies and our model accounts for the experimentally observed enhancement in thermal conductivity.},

We used scanning tunneling microscopy and resonant elastic x-ray scattering measurements to establish the formation of charge ordering in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Depending on the hole concentration, the charge ordering in this system occurs with the same period as those found in Y-based or La-based cuprates and displays the analogous competition with superconductivity. These results indicate the similarity of charge organization competing with superconductivity across different families of cuprates. We observed this charge ordering to leave a distinct electron-hole asymmetric signature (and a broad resonance centered at +20 milli–electron volts) in spectroscopic measurements, indicating that it is likely related to the organization of holes in a doped Mott insulator.},

abstract = {The process of natural ageing in pure ternary Al-Mg-Si alloys was studied by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy in real time in order to clarify the sequence and kinetics of clustering and precipitation. It was found that natural ageing take place in at least 5 stages in these alloys, four of which were directly observed. This is interpreted as the result of complex interactions between vacancies and solute atoms or clusters. One of the early stages of positron lifetime evolution coincides with a clustering process observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and involves the formation of a positron trap with around 0.200 ns lifetime. In later stages, a positron trap with a higher lifetime develops in coincidence with the DSC signal of a second clustering reaction. Mg governs both the kinetics and the lifetime change in this stage. Within the first 10 minutes after quenching, a period of nearly constant positron lifetime was found for those Mg-rich alloys that later show an insufficient hardness response to artificial ageing, the so-called `negative effect'. The various processes observed could be described by two effective activation energies that were found by varying the ageing temperature from 10{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}C to 37{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}C.},

                        2Si) thin films for thermoelectric applications, using reactive diffusion in vacuum. This formation is compared to that obtained by treatment in conventional high-vacuum furnace. Reaction between Mg and Si substrate occurs approximately at 200 ??C and its rate depends on the temperature and the heating rate of annealing, while the treatment duration determines the completeness of the reaction. These observations confirm the diffusion governed process of Mg silicidation. Two simultaneous processes occur in the films: Mg desorption from the surface and silicide formation at the Si/Mg interface. Applying the annealing temperature of 350 ??C is likely the sufficient condition to complete the reaction. The obtained films have shown stability regarding decomposition until the temperature of 450 ??C. However, in the presence of oxygen-contaminated atmosphere the Mg 
                        2Si tends to decompose at lower temperatures starting from circa 300 ??C and dissociated magnesium oxidizes. The rapid thermal annealing of Mg/Si layers allows to decrease the duration of silicide formation, while the risk of decomposition of Mg

The results are illustrated for the case of the Lennard-Jones potential, wherein forces are exact and FCs can be analytically calculated, and Si in the diamond structure. The latter are compared to the previously calculated harmonic FCs.},

@article{Cahill2014,
abstract = {A diverse spectrum of technology drivers such as improved thermal barriers, higher efficiency thermoelectric energy conversion, phase-change memory, heat-assisted magnetic recording, thermal management of nanoscale electronics, and nanoparticles for thermal medical therapies are motivating studies of the applied physics of thermal transport at the nanoscale. This review emphasizes developments in experiment, theory, and computation in the past ten years and summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces become increasingly important on small length scales. Research during the past decade has extended studies of interfaces between simple metals and inorganic crystals to interfaces with molecular materials and liquids with systematic control of interface chemistry and physics. At separations on the order of ∼ 1 nm , the science of radiative transport through nanoscale gaps overlaps with thermal conduction by the coupling of electronic and vibrational excitations across weakly bonded or rough interfaces between materials. Major advances in the physics of phonons include first principles calculation of the phonon lifetimes of simple crystals and application of the predicted scattering rates in parameter-free calculations of the thermal conductivity. Progress in the control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is critical to continued advances in the density of information that can be stored in phase change memory devices and new generations of magnetic storage that will use highly localized heat sources to reduce the coercivity of magnetic media. Ultralow thermal conductivity—thermal conductivity below the conventionally predicted minimum thermal conductivity—has been observed in nanolaminates and disordered crystals with strong anisotropy. Advances in metrology by time-domain thermoreflectance have made measurements of the thermal conductivity of a thin layer with micron-scale spatial resolution relatively routine. Scanning thermal microscopy and thermal analysis using proximal probes has achieved spatial resolution of 10 nm, temperature precision of 50 mK, sensitivity to heat flows of 10 pW, and the capability for thermal analysis of sub-femtogram samples.},

@article{Saaskilahti2015,
abstract = {Harnessing the power of low-dimensional materials in thermal applications calls for a solid understanding of the anomalous thermal properties of such systems. We analyze thermal conduction in one-dimensional systems by determining the frequency-dependent phonon mean free paths (MFPs) for an anharmonic chain, delivering insight into the diverging thermal conductivity observed in computer simulations. In our approach, the MFPs are extracted from the length-dependence of the spectral heat current obtained from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At low frequencies, the results reveal a power-law dependence of the MFPs on frequency, in agreement with the diverging conductivity and the recently determined equilibrium MFPs. At higher frequencies, however, the nonequilibrium MFPs consistently exceed the equilibrium MFPs, highlighting the differences between the two quantities. Exerting pressure on the chain is shown to suppress the mean free paths and to generate a weaker divergence of MFPs at low frequencies. The results deliver important insight into anomalous thermal conduction in low-dimensional systems and also reveal differences between the MFPs obtained from equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations.},

@article{Wang,
abstract = {Lattice defects such asvacancies, voidsanddislocations are inevitably present in any material of technological interest. In thiswork, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate how the monatomic vacancies and nanovoids influence the lattice thermal conductivity of silicon. The results show a clear non-linear decrease of the thermal conductivity with increasing defect volume fraction. Furthermore, it is found that for a given volume fraction of defects, a random distribution shows a lower lattice thermal conductivity. To develop a fundamental understanding of these observations, the spectral energy densities for all phonon branches obtained from 2D Fourier transformations of the atomic trajectories are analyzed. This yields the mean phonon group velocities and relaxation times, which are the main physical quantities contributing to the lattice thermal conductivity. Our analysis reveals that the phonon relaxation time is the most important parameter for describing the degrading of the thermal transport behavior in the defected structures.},

@article{Zhang2017a,
abstract = {Free energies of bulk materials are nowadays routinely computed by density functional theory. In particular for metals, electronic excitations can significantly contribute to the free energy. For an ideal static lattice, this contribution can be obtained at low computational cost, e.g., from the electronic density of states derived at T = 0 K or by utilizing the Sommerfeld approximation. The error introduced by these approximations at elevated temperatures is rarely known. The error arising from the ideal lattice approximation is likewise unexplored but computationally much more challenging to overcome. In order to shed light on these issues we have computed the electronic free energies for all 3d, 4d, and 5d transition elements on the ideal lattices of the bcc, fcc, and hcp structures using finite-temperature density-functional theory. For a subset of elements we have explored the impact of explicit thermal vibrations on the electronic free energies by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We provide an analysis of the observed chemical trends in terms of the electronic density of states and the canonical d band model and quantify the errors in the approximate methods. The electronic contribution to the heat capacities and the corresponding errors due to the different approximations are studied as well.},

It recovers the result of Cochran and Cowley [Cochran and Cowley, J. Phys. Chem. Solids 23, 447 (1962)] at the long wavelength limit. UsingMgO as the prototype, we demonstrate that a 16-atom 2 x 2 x 2 supercell of the primitive unit cell is sufficient to obtain the phonon dispersions when the dipole-dipole interactions are considered. We find that not properly taking into account the dipole-dipole interaction leads to oscillations along the (0,0,q) direction for the longitudinal optical phonon dispersion in a 128-atom elongated 1 x 1 x 16 supercell with a cubic structure.},

In GaN we find a large increase to the thermal conductivity with isotopic enrichment, ∼65{\%} at room temperature. We show that both the high thermal conductivity and its enhancement with isotopic enrichment in GaN arise from the weak coupling of heat-carrying acoustic phonons with optic phonons. This weak scattering results from stiff atomic bonds and the large Ga to N mass ratio, which give phonons high frequencies and also a pronounced energy gap between acoustic and optic phonons compared to other materials. Rigorous understanding of these features in GaN gives important insights into the interplay between intrinsic phonon-phonon scattering and isotopic scattering in a range of materials.},

However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Based on an analysis of the short range chemical environment of each atom in a system, standard machine learning based approaches to the construction of interatomic potentials aim at determining directly the central quantity which is the total energy. This prevents for instance an accurate description of the energetics of systems where long range charge transfer is important as well as of ionized systems. We propose therefore not to target directly with machine learning methods the total energy but an intermediate physical quantity namely the charge density, which then in turn allows to determine the total energy. By allowing the electronic charge to distribute itself in an optimal way over the system, we can describe not only neutral but also ionized systems with unprecedented accuracy. We demonstrate the power of our approach for both neutral and ionized NaCl clusters where charge redistribution plays a decisive role for the energetics. We are able to obtain chemical accuracy, i.e. errors of less than a milli Hartree per atom compared to the reference density functional results. The introduction of physically motivated quantities which are determined by the short range atomic environment via a neural network leads also to an increased stability of the machine learning process and transferability of the potential.},

abstract = {One challenge in computational biophysics and biology is to develop methodologies able to estimate accurately the configurational entropy of macromolecules. Among many methods, the quasiharmonic approximation (QH) is most widely used as it is simple in both theory and implementation. However, it has been shown that this method becomes inaccurate by overestimating entropy for systems with rugged free energy landscapes. Here, we propose a simple method to improve the QH approximation, i.e., to reduce QH entropy. We approximate the potential energy landscape of the system by an effective harmonic potential, and request that this potential must produce exactly the configurational temperature of the system. Due to this constraint, the force constants associated with the effective harmonic potential are increased, or equivalently, entropy of motion governed by this effective harmonic potential is reduced. We also introduce the effective configurational temperature concept which can be used as an indicator to check the anharmonicity of the free energy landscape. To validate the new method we compare it with the recently developed expansion approximate method by calculating entropy of one simple model system and two peptides with 3 and 16 amino acids either in gas phase or in explicit solvent. We show that the new method appears to be a good choice in practice as it is a compromise between accuracy and computational speed. A modification of the expansion approximate method is also introduced and advantages are discussed in some detail.},

@article{Bjorck1994,
abstract = {The Gram-Schmidt (GS) orthogonalization is one of the fundamental procedures in linear algebra. In matrix terms it is equivalent to the factorization A=Q1R, where Q1∈Rm×n with orthonormal columns and R upper triangular. For the numerical GS factorization of a matrix A two different versions exist, usually called classical and modified Gram-Schmidt (CGS and MGS). Although mathematically equivalent, these have very different numerical properties. This paper surveys the numerical properties of CGS and MGS. A key observation is that MGS is numerically equivalent to Householder QR factorization of the matrix A augmented by an n×n zero matrix on top. This can be used to derive bounds on the loss of orthogonality in MGS, and to develop a backward-stable algorithm based on MGS. The use of reorthogonalization and iterated CGS and MGS algorithms are discussed. Finally, block versions of GS are described.},

It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

Here, we use density-functional perturbation theory and an exact, variational solution of the Boltzmann transport equation to study fully from first-principles phonon transport and heat conductivity in graphene, boron nitride, molybdenum disulphide and the functionalized derivatives graphane and fluorographene. In all these materials, and at variance with typical three-dimensional solids, normal processes keep dominating over Umklapp scattering well-above cryogenic conditions, extending to room temperature and more. As a result, novel regimes emerge, with Poiseuille and Ziman hydrodynamics, hitherto typically confined to ultra-low temperatures, characterizing transport at ordinary conditions. Most remarkably, several of these two-dimensional materials admit wave-like heat diffusion, with second sound present at room temperature and above in graphene, boron nitride and graphane.},

abstract = {The frequencies of normal modes of vibration of potassium at 9�K have been measured by inelastic-neutron-scattering techniques. Certain selected frequencies are (units 1012 cps): H15 2.21�0.02, P4 1.785�0.02, N1? 2.40�0.04, N3? 1.50�0.025, and N4? 0.53�0.02. The results are very similar, apart from a scale factor 1.65, to those for sodium. Analysis of the results has been carried out in terms both of conventional Born-von K�rm�n models and of potential functions defined in reciprocal space. A fifth-neighbor, axially symmetric force model has been used to compute the frequency distribution function for the normal modes and the associated heat capacity. The reciprocal-space analysis was performed in two ways: (a) in terms of a total potential function, whose Fourier transform is the effective interatomic potential between "neutral pseudo-atoms" of potassium, and (b) in terms of the screened pseudopotential for the conduction-electron-ion interaction. Analysis (a) shows that a wide variety of interatomic potentials, both with and without long-range oscillatory character, can be found which give a satisfactory fit to the results. These potentials are compared with those obtained from an analysis of x-ray scattering data for liquid potassium. The pseudopotentials obtained from analysis (b) are in good agreement with that derived by Bortolani from the Heine-Abarenkov model. A reanalysis of the phonon dispersion curves for sodium leads to very similar conclusions, confirming earlier work by Cochran.},

abstract = {Determining the types and concentrations of vacancies present in intentionally doped GaN is a notoriously difficult and long-debated problem. Here we use an unconventional approach, based on thermal transport modeling, to determine the prevalence of vacancies in previous measurements. This allows us to provide conclusive evidence of the recent hypothesis that gallium vacancies in ammonothermally grown samples can be complexed with hydrogen. Our calculations for O-doped and Mg-O co-doped samples yield a consistent picture interlinking dopant and vacancy concentration, carrier density, and thermal conductivity, in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. These results also highlight the predictive power of ab initio phonon transport modeling, and its value for understanding and quantifying defects in semiconductors.},

@article{Ceriotti2019,
abstract = {Automated analyses of the outcome of a simulation have been an important part of atomistic modeling since the early days, addressing the need of linking the behavior of individual atoms and the collective properties that are usually the final quantity of interest. Methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction have been used to provide a simplified, coarse-grained representation of the structure and dynamics of complex systems, from proteins to nanoparticles. In recent years, the rise of machine learning has led to an even more widespread use of these algorithms in atomistic modeling, and to consider different classification and inference techniques as part of a coherent toolbox of data-driven approaches. This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning methods -- that are geared towards classification and coarse-graining of molecular simulations -- seen in relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques. It discusses the importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures as the starting point of the analyses, and highlights the risk of introducing preconceived biases when using machine learning to rationalize and understand structure-property relations. Supervised machine-learning techniques, that explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material given its structure, are less susceptible to such biases. Current developments in the field suggest that using these two classes of approaches side-by-side and in a fully integrated mode, while keeping in mind the relations between the data analysis framework and the fundamental physical principles, will be key for realizing the full potential of machine learning to help understanding the behavior of complex molecules and materials.},

abstract = {The conductances of linear chains of gold atoms suspended between two electrodes were calculated while the distance between the electrodes was increased. The stable structures of the linear chains of the gold atoms at low temperature were initially determined by using the ab initio local spin-density-functional approach. As the average bond length [d] increased, the spacings of the neighboring gold atoms modulated similarly to the Peierls transition. The maximum tensile force of a linear four-atom-chain was 0.91 nN and occurred at [d] approximate to 3.1 Angstrom. The electric conductances were then calculated using the recursion transfer-matrix method. The calculation indicated that the conductance at the Fermi level of the modulated chain decreased from 1G(0) (= 2e(2)/h) as the chain was stretched.},

abstract = {In recent years, the fundamental physics of spin-thermal (i.e., magnon-phonon) interaction has attracted significant experimental and theoretical interests given its potential paradigm-shifting impacts in areas like spin-thermoelectrics, spin-caloritronics and spintronics. Modelling studies of the transport of magnons and phonons in magnetic crystals are very rare. In this paper, we use spin-lattice dynamics (SLD) simulations to model ferromagnetic crystalline iron, where the spin and lattice systems are coupled through the atomic position-dependent exchange function, and thus the interaction between magnon and phonon is naturally considered. We then present a method combining SLD simulations with spectral energy analysis to calculate the magnon and phonon harmonic (e.g., dispersion, specific heat, group velocity) and anharmonic (e.g., scattering rate) properties, based on which their thermal conductivity values are calculated. This work represents an example of using SLD simulations to understand the transport properties involving coupled magnon and phonon dynamics.},

abstract = {Nitride coatings are increasingly demanded in the cutting- and machining-tool industry owing to their hardness, thermal stability and resistance to corrosion. These properties derive from strongly covalent bonds; understanding the bonding is a requirement for the design of superhard materials with improved capabilities. Here, we report a pressure-induced cubic-to-orthorhombic transition at approximately 1 GPa in CrN. High-pressure X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations show an unexpected reduction of the bulk modulus, K0, of about 25{\%} in the high-pressure (lower volume) phase. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach shows that this effect is the result of a large exchange striction due to the approach of the localized Cr:t3 electrons to becoming molecular-orbital electrons in Cr-Cr bonds. The softening of CrN under pressure is a manifestation of a strong competition between different types of chemical bond that are found at a crossover from a localized to a molecular-orbital electronic transition.},

abstract = {A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a superconducting transition temperature, Tc. The highest Tc that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system: 133 kelvin at ambient pressure and 164 kelvin at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high Tc with no theoretical upper bound—all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron–phonon coupling, and a high density of states. These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen, as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron–phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50–235 kelvin for many hydrides, but only a moderate Tc of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally. Here we investigate sulfur hydride, where a Tc of 80 kelvin has been predicted. We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a Tc of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of Tc in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron–phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S, formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-based materials.},

The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}n{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}′{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance.

The experiments show that, surprisingly, although SnTe is closer to the ferroelectric instability, phonon spectra in PbTe exhibit a more anharmonic character. This behavior is reproduced in first-principles calculations of the temperature-dependent phonon self-energy. Our simulations reveal how the nesting of phonon dispersions induces prominent features in the self-energy, which account for the measured INS spectra and their temperature dependence. We establish that the phase-space for three-phonon scattering processes, rather than just the proximity to the lattice instability, is the mechanism determining the complex spectrum of the transverse-optical ferroelectric mode.},

abstract = {The most widely taught example of a magnetic transition is that of Fe at 1043 K. Despite the high temperature most discussions of this transition focus on the magnetic states of a fixed spin lattice with lattice vibrations analyzed separately and simply added. We propose a model of alpha iron that fully couples spin and displacement degrees of freedom. Results demonstrate a significant departure from models that treat these coordinates independently. The success of the model rests on a first principles calculation of changes in energy with respect to spin configurations on a bcc-iron lattice with displacements. Complete details of environment-dependent exchange interactions that augment the Finnis-Sinclair potential are given and comparisons to measurements are made. We find that coupling has no effect on critical exponents, a small effect on the transition temperature, T-c, and a large effect on the entropy of transformation. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.214423},

Although the vast majority of recent work in AM has focused on three-dimensional printing in polymers, AM techniques for fabricating metal alloys have been available for more than a decade. Here, laser deposition (LD) is used to fabricate multifunctional metal alloys that have a strategically graded composition to alter their mechanical and physical properties. Using the technique in combination with rotational deposition enables fabrication of compositional gradients radially from the center of a sample. A roadmap for developing gradient alloys is presented that uses multi-component phase diagrams as maps for composition selection so as to avoid unwanted phases. Practical applications for the new technology are demonstrated in low-coefficient of thermal expansion radially graded metal inserts for carbon-fiber spacecraft panels.},

abstract = {The applications of machine learning techniques to chemistry and materials science become more numerous by the day. The main challenge is to devise representations of atomic systems that are at the same time complete and concise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed to predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has led to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into an input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract definition of chemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a bra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the connections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic systems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their chemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets, which can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the atom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) power spectrum, but also in real space, corresponding to {\$}n{\$}-body correlations of the atom density. This formalism lays the foundations for a more systematic tuning of the behavior of the representations, by introducing operators that represent the correlations between structure, composition, and the target properties. It provides a unifying picture of recent developments in the field and indicates a way forward towards more effective and computationally affordable machine-learning schemes for molecules and materials.},

An excellent quantitative agreement with previous experimental measurements is found. The results unveil that B{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}{\$} substitution has a much stronger effect than any of the other defect types in 3C-SiC, including vacancies. This finding contradicts the prediction of the classical mass-difference model of impurity scattering, according to which the effects of B{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}{\$} and N{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}{\$} would be similar and much smaller than that of the C vacancy. The strikingly different behavior of the B{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}{\$} defect arises from a unique pattern of resonant phonon scattering caused by the broken structural symmetry around the B impurity.},

abstract = {Understanding the microscopic processes affecting the bulk thermal conductivity is crucial to develop more efficient thermoelectric materials. PbTe is currently one of the leading thermoelectric materials, largely thanks to its low thermal conductivity. However, the origin of this low thermal conductivity in a simple rocksalt structure has so far been elusive. Using a combination of inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles computations of the phonons, we identify a strong anharmonic coupling between the ferroelectric transverse optic mode and the longitudinal acoustic modes in PbTe. This interaction extends over a large portion of reciprocal space, and directly affects the heat-carrying longitudinal acoustic phonons. The longitudinal acoustic-transverse optic anharmonic coupling is likely to play a central role in explaining the low thermal conductivity of PbTe. The present results provide a microscopic picture of why many good thermoelectric materials are found near a lattice instability of the ferroelectric type.},

abstract = {The band-unfolding method is widely used to calculate the effective band structures of a disordered system from its supercell model. The unfolded band structures show the crystallographic symmetry of the underlying structure, where the difference of chemical components and the local atomic relaxation are ignored. It has been, however, still difficult to decompose the unfolded band structures into the modes based on the crystallographic symmetry of the underlying structure, and therefore detailed analyses of the unfolded band structures have been restricted. In this study, we develop a procedure to decompose the unfolded band structures according to the small representations (SRs) of the little groups. For this purpose, we derive the projection operators for SRs based on the group representation theory. We also introduce another type of projection operators for chemical elements, which enables us to decompose the unfolded band structures into the contributions of different combinations of chemical elements. Using the current method, we investigate the phonon band structure of disordered face-centered cubic Cu0.75Au0.25, which has large variations of atomic masses and force constants among the atomic sites due to the chemical disorder. We find several peculiar behaviors such as discontinuous and split branches in the unfolded phonon band structure. They are found to occur because different combinations of the chemical elements contribute to different regions of frequency.},

The predicted optical phonon transport is temperature independent and small, while the acoustic component follows the Slack relation and is in good agreement with the limited single-crystal experimental results. Considering the phonon grain-boundary and pore scatterings, the effective lattice thermal conductivity is reduced, and we show it is in general agreement with the sintered-powder experimental results. The charge and photon thermal conductivities are also addressed, and we find small roles for electron, surface polaron, and photon in the defect-free structures and for temperatures below 1500 K.

abstract = {The daily motion of the Moon through the sky has many unusual features that a careful observer can discover without the help of instruments. The three different frequencies for the three degrees of freedom have been known very accurately for 3000 years, and the geometric explanation of the Greek astronomers was basically correct. Whereas Kepler's laws are sufficient for describing the motion of the planets around the Sun, even the most obvious facts about the lunar motion cannot be understood without the gravitational attraction of both the Earth and the Sun. Newton discussed this problem at great length, and with mixed success; it was the only testing ground for his Universal Gravitation. This background for today's many-body theory is discussed in some detail because all the guiding principles for our understanding can be traced to the earliest developments of astronomy. They are the oldest results of scientific inquiry, and they were the first ones to be confirmed by the great physicist-mathematicians of the 18th century. By a variety of methods, Laplace was able to claim complete agreement of celestial mechanics with the astronomical observations. Lagrange initiated a new trend wherein the mathematical problems of mechanics could all be solved by the same uniform process; canonical transformations eventually won the field. They were used for the first time on a large scale by Delaunay to find the ultimate solution of the lunar problem by perturbing the solution of the two-body Earth-Moon problem. Hill then treated the lunar trajectory as a displacement from a periodic orbit that is an exact solution of a restricted three-body problem. Newton's difficultly in explaining the motion of the lunar perigee was finally resolved, and the Moon's orbit was computed by a new method that became the universal standard until after WW II. Poincare´ opened the 20th century with his analysis of trajectories in phase space, his insistence on investigating periodic orbits even in ergodic systems, and his critique of perturbation theory, particularly in the case of the Moon's motion. Space exploration, astrophysics, and the landing of the astronauts on the Moon led to a new flowering of celestial mechanics. Lunar theory now has to confront many new data beyond the simple three-body problem in order to improve its accuracy below the precision of 1 arcsecond; the computer dominates all the theoretical advances. This review is intended as a case study of the many stages that characterize the slow development of a problem in physics from simple observations through many forms of explanation to a high-precision fit with the data.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics can be used as a very e ective, general-purpose approach to generate atomic con gurations for a material or chemical compound that are consistent with prescribed experimental conditions. It is an ideal companion to ab initio electronic structure methods, that allow one to evaluate the inter-atomic forces from rst principles, avoiding the time-consuming and at times inaccurate process of designing an empirical model. Unfortunately, ab initio methods are still computationally demanding, and so it is desirable to modify the properties of the dynamics to get a more e ective exploration of phase space than allowed by the intrinsic system's dynamics. A very e ective approach to manipulate the sampling behaviour of a molecular dynamics simulation exploits non-Markovian, Generalized Langevin Equations (GLEs) that have been used in the past to model the coupling of the system with a physical bath. Within this framework, the impact of the correlated noise on static and dynamic properties of the trajectory can be predicted analytically in the harmonic limit. One can therefore optimize the performances of the GLE a priori, and obtain e ects that range from e ective sampling of all the relevant time scales, to ne-tuned control of the disturbance of dynamics for di erent frequency ranges, to the design of non-equilibrium trajectories that can be used to model zero-point energy and other nuclear quantum e ects and even to evaluate matrix functions with linear scaling e ort. Correlated noise can also be combined with imaginary time path integral molecular dynamics, to obtain fast and systematic convergence of properties that depend on the quantum nature of light nuclei {\{} that are paramount for materials that contain hydrogen. This review will introduce the theoretical basis of the GLE thermostat framework and will brie y discuss the many ways it can be used to manipulate the sampling properties of molecular dynamics. The practical implementation will also be covered, and a few selected applications in the context of ab initio molecular dynamics will be presented as examples.}},

Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. !!!!! Running time: The run-time depends on the required level of accuracy of the final potential. For an EAM potential fit to 670 energies, a few hours on a single core is usually sufficient to produce a potential with R=12{\%}–13{\%} (see Equation. 9 in main-text for definition). To ensure a maximally optimized potential however (R=12{\%}), a run-time of 24 h is recommended. To optimize a RF-MEAM potential, a further 24 h should be allowed. One will already find an improvement over the EAM using just a single core, however to ensure a maximally optimized potential, one should run several instances of MEAMfit in parallel.

abstract = {The surface finish was extensively studied in usual machining processes (turning, milling, and drilling). For these processes, the surface finish is strongly influenced by the cutting feed and the tool nose radius. However, a basic understanding of tool/surface finish interaction and residual stress generation has been lacking. This paper aims to investigate the surface finish and residual stresses under the orthogonal cutting since it can provide this information by avoiding the effect of the tool nose radius. The orthogonal machining of AA7075-T651 alloy through a series of cutting experiments was performed under dry conditions. Surface finish was studied using height and amplitude distribution roughness parameters. SEM and EDS were used to analyze surface damage and built-up edge (BUE) formation. An analysis of the surface topography showed that the surface roughness was sensitive to changes in cutting parameters. It was found that the formation of BUE and the interaction between the tool edge and the iron-rich intermetallic particles play a determinant role in controlling the surface finish during dry orthogonal machining of the AA7075-T651 alloy. Hoop stress was predominantly compressive on the surface and tended to be tensile with increased cutting speed. The reverse occurred for the surface axial stress. The smaller the cutting feed, the greater is the effect of cutting speed on both axial and hoop stresses. By controlling the cutting speed and feed, it is possible to generate a benchmark residual stress state and good surface finish using dry machining.},

abstract = {Solid He is studied in the pressure and temperature ranges 1-40 TPa and 0-10,000 K using first-principles methods. Anharmonic vibrational properties are calculated within a self-consistent field framework, including the internal and free energies, density-pressure relation, stress tensor, thermal expansion, and the electron-phonon coupling renormalization of the electronic band gap. We find that an accurate description of electron-phonon coupling requires us to use a non-perturbative approach. The metalization pressure of 32.9 TPa at 0 K is larger than found previously. The vibrational effects are large; for example at P=30 TPa the band gap is increased by 2.8 eV by electron-phonon coupling and a further 0.1 eV by thermal expansion compared to the static value. The implications of the calculated metalization pressure for the cooling of white dwarfs are discussed.},

At elevated temperatures significant discrepancies are found between experiment and perturbation theory, which disappear when using molecular dynamics due to the inclusion of full anharmonicity and the correct treatment of the multi-phonon background. We show that multiple-site interactions are small and that local pairwise anharmonicity dominates phonon-phonon interactions, which permits an efficient computation of phonon lifetimes.},

abstract = {The peak-hardness aged (T6) precipitates in 6061 (Mg:Si ≈ 2:1) and Si-enriched 6061 (Mg:Si ≈ 1:1.1) alloys have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Mg-Si-Cu rich solute clusters/GP-zones, needle-shaped precipitates and lath-shaped precipitates coexist in both alloys at the T6 condition. The needle-shaped precipitates were dominant in both alloys. The alloy's overall composition strongly influences the needle-shaped precipitate's Mg:Si ratio and crystal structure. In the Si-enriched 6061 alloy these precipitates typically have an average Mg:Si ratio of 1.25:1 and monoclinic crystal structures in good agreement with the pre-$\beta$″ and $\beta$″ phases. The standard 6061 alloy's higher overall Mg:Si ratio increases the needle-shaped precipitate's average Mg:Si ratio to 1.65:1. This high ratio was a result of a reduction in the precipitate's Si content rather than an increase in the Mg content, which is believed to be enabled by the formation of needles with mixed $\beta$″/disordered structures. The alloy's overall composition also influences the lath-shaped precipitate's crystal structure with Q′ laths identified in the Si-enriched 6061 alloy while disordered L-phase laths were identified in the standard 6061 alloy. The current work shows that high Mg:Si ratio Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys promote more disordered precipitate distributions.},

To evaluate the stability under process conditions, empirical potentials and ab initio calculations at T=0K are often not sufficient.

Examples for the importance of accurately describing defect properties include the stabilization of vacancies by impurities and the non-Arrhenius behaviour of vacancy formation energies due to anharmonic lattice vibrations.},

abstract = {To reveal the operating mechanisms of plastic deformation in an FCC high-entropy alloy, the activation volumes in CrMnFeCoNi have been measured as a function of plastic strain and temperature between 77 K and 423 K using repeated load relaxation experiments. At the yield stress, $\sigma$y, the activation volume varies from ∼60 b3at 77 K to ∼360 b3at 293 K and scales inversely with yield stress. With increasing plastic strain, the activation volume decreases and the trends follow the Cottrell-Stokes law, according to which the inverse activation volume should increase linearly with $\sigma$−$\sigma$y(Haasen plot). This is consistent with the notion that hardening due to an increase in the density of forest dislocations is naturally associated with a decrease in the activation volume because the spacing between dislocations decreases. The values and trends in activation volume agree with theoretical predictions that treat the HEA as a high-concentration solid-solution-strengthened alloy. These results demonstrate that this HEA deforms by the mechanisms typical of solute strengthening in FCC alloys, and thus indicate that the high compositional/structural complexity does not introduce any new intrinsic deformation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Direct carrier multiplication (DCM) occurs when a highly excited electron-hole pair decays by transferring its excess energy to the electrons rather than to the lattice, possibly exciting additional electron-hole pairs. Atomistic electronic structure calculations have shown that DCM can be induced by electron-hole Coulomb interactions, in an impact-ionization-like process whose rate is proportional to the density of biexciton states rho XX. Here we introduce a DCM "figure of merit" R2(E) which is proportional to the ratio between the biexciton density of states rhoXX and the single-exciton density of states rhoX, restricted to single-exciton and biexciton states that are coupled by Coulomb interactions. Using R2(E), we consider GaAs, InAs, InP, GaSb, InSb, CdSe, Ge, Si, and PbSe nanocrystals of different sizes. Although DCM can be affected by both quantum-confinement effects (reflecting the underly electronic structure of the confined dot-interior states) and surface effects, here we are interested to isolate the former. To this end the nanocrystal energy levels are obtained from the corresponding bulk band structure via the truncated crystal approximation. We find that PbSe, Si, GaAs, CdSe, and InP nanocrystals have larger DCM figure of merit than the other nanocrystals. Our calculations suggest that high DCM efficiency requires high degeneracy of the corresponding bulk band-edge states. Interestingly, by considering band structure effects we find that as the dot size increases the DCM critical energy E0 (the energy at which R2(E) becomes {\textgreater}or=1) is reduced, suggesting improved DCM. However, whether the normalized E0/epsilong increases or decreases as the dot size increases depends on dot material.},

@article{Vocadlo2000,
abstract = {The Gruneisen parameter (fl is of considerable importance to Earth scientists because it sets limitations on the thermoelastic properties of the lower mantle and core. However, there are several formulations of the Gruneisen parameter in frequent use which nor only give different values for gamma at ambient pressure but also predict a varying dependence of gamma as a function of compression. The Gruneisen parameter is directly related to the equation of state (EOS), yet it is often the case that both the form of gamma and the EOS are chosen independently of each other and somewhat arbitrarily. In this paper we have assessed some of the more common definitions of the Gruneisen parameter and the EOS, and have applied them to a test material. OF the EOS considered, when compared against ab initio compressional data for hcp-Fe as our exemplar, we find that the fourth order logarithmic and Vinet relations describe the material with the highest accuracy. Of the expressions for gamma considered it has been suggested, on theoretical grounds, that the modified free-volume formulation should be expected to give the most realistic description of the thermoelastic behavior of a material. However, when we use the fourth order logarithmic EOS to obtain the compressional behavior of the various Gruneisen parameters, we find that there is, in fact, poor agreement between the modified free-volume formulation and the Mie-Gruneisen parameter obtained directly from ab initio free energy calculations on hcp-Fe. We conclude that none of the analytical forms of gamma are sufficiently sophisticated to describe the thermoelastic behavior of real materials with great accuracy, and care must therefore be taken when attempting to model the thermoelastic behavior of solids to ensure that the appropriate gamma (ideally obtained from experiments or ab initio calculations) and equations of state are used.},

Crucially, these waves do not represent single-particle excitations, but are collective excitations of the equilibrium distribution functions. We study in detail the case of thermal transport, where relaxons are found in the long-wavelength limit, and second sound is reinterpreted as the excitation of one or several temperature waves at finite frequencies. Graphene is studied numerically, finding decay times of the order of microseconds. The derivation, obtained by a spectral representation of the Boltzmann equation, holds in principle for any crystal or semiclassical transport theory and is particularly relevant when transport takes place in the hydrodynamic regime.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the algorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods--due to the cost, time or effort involved--but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative--extending into new materials spaces--provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven "materials informatics" strategies undertaken in the last decade, and identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.},

abstract = {The dispersion relations for aluminum have been determined at 80 and 300°K by neutron spectrometry, using a three-axis crystal spectrometer. Particular attention was paid to precision, in order to investigate small effects—e.g., Kohn anomalies, phonon frequency widths, frequency shifts with temperature—and to establish an accurate experimental routine. A focusing method used throughout to optimize resolution is described, as well as a method for calculating energy resolution and extracting phonon widths from observed one-phonon resonances. Results are presented as dispersion curves for phonons in the three principal directions, accompanied by phonon widths, and as contour maps of phonon frequency on the surface of an elemental tetrahedron in q space. Measurements at points off the principal directions are utilized in the latter maps. Kohn anomalies have been observed, but are reported elsewhere. Phonon widths at 80°K are interpreted semiquantitatively in terms of the interaction between phonons and conduction electrons. Exceptionally large phonon widths in two regions may be due to singularities in the phonon-phonon interaction: the conservation rules for decay of a phonon into two phonons suggest a source for such singularities, but the suggestion has not been confirmed by computation.},

abstract = {Statistical learning methods show great promise in providing an accurate prediction of materials and molecular properties, while minimizing the need for computationally demanding electronic structure calculations. The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that can be used to perform machine-learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous electrical response of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.},

abstract = {Many physical properties of metals can be understood in terms of the free electron model, as proven by the Wiedemann-Franz law. According to this model, electronic thermal conductivity ({\$}\backslashkappa{\_}{\{}el{\}}{\$}) can be inferred from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). However, the BTE does not perform well for some complex metals, such as Cu. Moreover, the BTE cannot clearly describe the origin of the thermal energy carried by electrons or how this energy is transported in metals. The charge distribution of conduction electrons in metals is known to reflect the electrostatic potential (EP) of the ion cores. Based on this premise, we develop a new methodology for evaluating {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}{\{}el{\}}{\$} by combining the free electron model and non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (NEAIMD) simulations. We demonstrate that the kinetic energy of thermally excited electrons originates from the energy of the spatial electrostatic potential oscillation (EPO), which is induced by the thermal motion of ion cores. This method directly predicts the {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}{\{}el{\}}{\$} of pure metals with a high degree of accuracy.},

The new implementation extends the functionality of the original version, provides a much more convenient user interface (both graphical/interactive and batch), and can be used as a tool set for implementing new analysis modules. This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor. The possibility to compute memory function is a new and powerful feature that allows to relate simulation results to theoretical studies.},

The isopropoxide groups are readily exchanged with $\alpha$- or $\beta$-hydroxyacids to form chelated complexes. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy indicate that the salan ligands are quite flexible, with (An2N)LTiF(2), for example, showing four stereoisomers in its (19)F NMR spectrum. The major stereoisomer of (salan)Ti(X)(Y) depends principally on the trans influence of the X and Y groups. Complexes of (An2N)L show two reversible, closely spaced redox couples at approximately + 0.1 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium, and a second set of two closely spaced redox couples at + 0.8 V vs. Fc/Fc(+).},

@article{Castin2018,
abstract = {Machine learning, and more specifically artificial neural networks (ANN), are powerful and flexible numerical tools that can lead to significant improvements in many materials modelling techniques. This paper provides a review of the efforts made so far to describe the effects of irradiation in Fe-based and W-based alloys, in a multiscale modelling framework. ANN were successfully used as innovative parametrization tools in these models, thereby greatly enhancing their physical accuracy and capability to accomplish increasingly challenging goals. In the provided examples, the main goal of ANN is to predict how the chemical complexity of local atomic configurations, and/or specific strain fields, influence the activation energy of selected thermally-activated events. This is most often a more efficient approach with respect to previous computationally heavy methods. In a future perspective, similar schemes can be potentially used to calculate other quantities than activation energies. They can thus transfer atomic-scale properties to higher-scale simulations, providing a proper bridging across scales, and hence contributing to the achievement of accurate and reliable multiscale models.},

@article{Nicklow1967,
abstract = {Phonon frequencies for wave vectors along the principal symmetry directions in copper have been determined at 49 and 298°K from neutron inelastic-scattering measurements. In general, the temperature dependences of the frequencies were found to be smaller for the higher-frequency modes. For the lower frequencies ($\nu$≲3×1012 cps), the frequency changes measured are consistent with the 3-4{\%} changes estimated from the isothermal elastic constants. For higher frequencies the relative changes are much smaller, often being 1{\%} or less. Axially symmetric force models, which included interactions to the sixth nearest neighbors, were fitted to the data and have been used to calculate a frequency distribution function g($\nu$) at each temperature. A comparison of the temperature dependences of the moments of these distributions with various Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameters leads to the conclusion that Cu does not satisfy the assumption of the quasiharmonic model. The Debye temperature $\Theta$C versus temperature curve calculated with the 49°K g($\nu$) is in excellent agreement with results from specific-heat measurements in the entire 0 to 298°K range. A fairly strong temperature dependence for the widths of some well-focused phonons was observed.},

@article{Bianchini2017,
abstract = {Na-ion technology is increasingly studied as a low-cost solution for grid storage applications. Many positive electrode materials have been reported, mainly among layered oxides and polyanionic compounds. The vanadium oxy/flurophosphate solid solution Na3V2(PO4)2F3-yO2y (0 ≤ y ≤ 1), in particular, has proven the ability to deliver ≈500 Wh kg-1, operating on the V3+/V4+ (y = 0) or V4+/V5+ redox couples (y = 1). This paper reports here on a significant increase in specific energy by enabling sodium insertion into Na3V2(PO4)2FO2 to reach Na4V2(PO4)2FO2 upon discharge. This occurs at ≈1.6 V and increases the theoretical specific energy to 600 Wh kg−1, rivaling that of several Li-ion battery cathodes. This improvement is achieved by the judicious modification of the composition either as O for F substitution, or Al for V substitution, both of which disrupt Na-ion ordering and thereby enable insertion of the 4th Na. This paper furthermore shows from operando X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) that this energy is obtained in the cycling range Na4V2(PO4)2FO2–NaV2(PO4)2FO2 with a very small overall volume change of 1.7{\%}, which is one of the smallest volume changes for Na-ion cathodes and which is a crucial requisite for stable long-term cycling.},

abstract = {Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g–1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2–O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn...},

abstract = {We present a scheme to obtain an inexpensive and reliable estimate of the uncertainty associated with the predictions of a machine-learning model of atomic and molecular properties. The scheme is based on resampling, with multiple models being generated based on sub-sampling of the same training data. The accuracy of the uncertainty prediction can be benchmarked by maximum likelihood estimation, which can also be used to correct for correlations between resampled models, and to improve the performance of the uncertainty estimation by a cross-validation procedure. In the case of sparse Gaussian Process Regression models, this resampled estimator can be evaluated at negligible cost. We demonstrate the reliability of these estimates for the prediction of molecular energetics, and for the estimation of nuclear chemical shieldings in molecular crystals. Extension to estimate the uncertainty in energy differences, forces, or other correlated predictions is straightforward. This method can be easily applied to other machine learning schemes, and will be beneficial to make data-driven predictions more reliable, and to facilitate training-set optimization and active-learning strategies.},

abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various micro-organisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: the steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density, for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations, but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: new effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

The program can predictively tackle phonon transport in bulk crystals and alloys, thin films, superlattices, and multiscale structures with size features in the nm–$\mu$m range. Among many other quantities, the program can output thermal conductances and effective thermal conductivities, space-resolved average temperature profiles, and heat-current distributions resolved in frequency and space. Its first-principles character makes almaBTE especially well suited to investigate novel materials and structures.

Here, we discover a pathway for the earliest-stage precipitation in Al-Mg-Si alloys: solute clustering leading to three successive variants of face-centered cubic (fcc) clusters, followed by the formation of non-fcc GP-zones. The clusters, which originally assume a spherical morphology (C1), evolve into elongated clusters and orient themselves on {\{}111{\}}Al(C2) and subsequently on {\{}100{\}}Alplanes and 〈100〉Aldirections (C3). We also analyze the association of quenched-in dislocations with clustering phenomena. The results of this work can open a new frontier in advancing alloy-process-property design for commercially important age-hardenable Al alloys.},

abstract = {Computing vibrational free energies ({\$}F{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$}) and entropies ({\$}S{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$}) has posed a long standing challenge to the high-throughput ab initio investigation of finite temperature properties of solids. Here we use machine-learning techniques to efficiently predict {\$}F{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$} and {\$}S{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$} of crystalline compounds in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. By employing descriptors based simply on the chemical formula and using a training set of only 300 compounds, mean absolute errors of less than 0.04 meV/K/atom (15 meV/atom) are achieved for {\$}S{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$} ({\$}F{\_}{\{}vib{\}}{\$}), whose values are distributed within a range of 0.9 meV/K/atom (300 meV/atom.) In addition, for training sets containing fewer than 2,000 compounds the chemical formula alone is shown to perform as well as, if not better than, four other more complex descriptors previously used in the literature. The accuracy and simplicity of the approach mean that it can be advantageously used for the fast screening of phase diagrams or chemical reactions at finite temperatures.},

abstract = {An experimental study of phonon lifetimes in lead using a novel high-resolution neutron spectrometer is presented. The spectrometer combines the neutron-resonance spin-echo and the three-axis techniques. Transverse-acoustic phonon modes in the low-q limit along the high-symmetry directions are investigated at temperatures between 5-300 K. We apply an analytical approach based on a Gaussian approximation of the instrumental resolution function to separate intrinsic lifetimes from artifactual damping due to sample mosaicity and curvature of the four-dimensional dispersion surface. Observed linewidths are significantly lower than predicted by a theoretical model of anharmonic lattice dynamics based on a force-constant parametrization of the interatomic potential. In the high-symmetry directions the q dependence of the linewidth is found to be linear. No change in lifetime is observed at the superconducting transition temperature T C .},

abstract = {Effective Hamiltonians, when used in tandem with statistical mechanics techniques, offer a rigorous connection between 0 Kelvin ab-initio predictions and finite temperature experimental observations. For alloys, cluster expansion Hamiltonians can coarse-grain out the complex, many-body electron problem of density functional theory, yielding a series of simple site-wise basis functions (e.g., products of site occupancy variables) on an atomic scale. The resulting energy polynomial is computationally inexpensive, and hence suitable for the (tens of) thousands of calculations of large systems required by stochastic methods. We present a new method to run the statical mechanics problem "in reverse", using high-temperature observations and thermodynamic connections to construct an effective Hamiltonian and thereby predict the 0 Kelvin energy spectrum and associated ground states. By re-examining the cluster expansion formalism through the lens of entropy-maximization approaches, we develop an algorithm to select clusters and determine cluster interactions using only a few, high-temperature experiments on disordered phases. We demonstrate that our approach can recover not only the stable ground states at 0 Kelvin, but also the full phase behavior for three realistic two-dimensional and three-dimensional alloy test-cases.},

The accuracy of the model was verified by MD simulations for molecular adsorption and desorption on a monatomic chain. By the prediction, a monatomic carbon chain should survive for 1.2 × 102 years in the ambient of 1 atm O2 at room temperature, and it is very invulnerable to N2, H2O, NO2, CO and CO2, while a monatomic gold chain quickly ruptures in vacuum. It is worth noting that since the model can be easily applied via common ab initio calculations, it could be widely used in the prediction of chemical stability of nanosystems.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivity K of single crystals of silicon has been measured from 3 to 1580°K and of single crystals of germanium from 3 to 1190°K. These measurements have been made using a steady-state, radial heat flow apparatus for T{\textgreater}300°K and a steady-state, longitudinal flow apparatus for T{\textless}300°K to give absolute K values. This radial flow technique eliminates thermal radiation losses at high temperatures. The accuracy of both the low-temperature apparatus and the high-temperature apparatus is approximately +/-5{\%}. Some special experimental techniques in using the high-temperature apparatus are briefly considered. At all temperatures the major contribution to K in Si and Ge is produced by phonons. The phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated from a combination of the relaxation times for boundary, isotope, three-phonon, and four-phonon scattering, and was found to agree with the experimental measurements. Above 700°K for Ge and 1000°K for Si an electronic contribution to K occurs, which agrees quite well with the theoretical estimates. At the respective melting points of Si and Ge, electrons and holes are responsible for 40{\%} of the total K and phonons are responsible for 60{\%}. The measured electronic K yields values for the thermal band gap at the melting point of 0.6+/-0.1 eV for Si and 0.26+/-0.08 eV for Ge.},

abstract = {We present calculations of the phase space for three-phonon scattering events in several group IV, III–V and II–VI semiconductors employing an adiabatic bond charge model to accurately represent the phonon dispersions. We demonstrate that this phase space varies inversely with the measured lattice thermal conductivities of these materials over a wide range of temperatures where three-phonon scattering is the dominant mechanism for scattering phonons. We find that this qualitative relationship is robust in spite of variations in material parameters between the semiconductors. Anomalous behavior occurs in three III–V materials that have large mass differences between constituent elements, which we explain in terms of the severely restricted three-phonon phase space arising from the large gap between acoustic and optic phonon branches.},

abstract = {We consider the anharmonic oscillator defined by the differential equation (-d2/dx2+1/4x2+1/4$\lambda$x4)$\Phi$(x)=E($\lambda$)$\Phi$(x) and the boundary condition limit of $\Phi$(x) as x→±∞=0. This model is interesting because the perturbation series for the ground-state energy diverges. To investigate the reason for this divergence, we analytically continue the energy levels of the Hamiltonian H into the complex $\lambda$ plane. Using WKB techniques, we find that the energy levels as a function of $\lambda$, or more generally of $\lambda$$\alpha$, have an infinite number of branch points with a limit point at $\lambda$=0. Thus, the origin is not an isolated singularity. Level crossing occurs at each branch point. If we choose $\alpha$=1/3, the resolvent (z-H)-1 has no branch cut. However, for all z it has an infinite sequence of poles which have a limit point at the origin. The anharmonic oscillator is of particular interest to field theoreticians because it is a model of $\lambda$ϕ4 field theory in one-dimensional space-time. The unusual and unexpected properties exhibited by this model may give some indication of the analytic structure of a more realistic field theory.},

Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Link{\"{o}}ping University, SE-581 83 Link{\"{o}}ping, Sweden. Correspondence to: Bj{\"{o}}rn Alling1 e-mail: bjoal@ifm.liu.se Introduction To the Editor: In their recent Nature Materials article, Rivadulla et al.1 reported an unexpected reduction of the bulk modulus (K0) of about 25{\%} in CrN at the pressure-induced transition from the cubic low-pressure phase to the orthorhombic high-pressure phase at {\~{}}1 GPa. As the authors were unable to experimentally measure with certainty the bulk modulus of the cubic phase that is stable only below 1 GPa, the evidence for the main conclusion of this work was obtained from ab initio calculations. The orthorhombic phase was considered to be antiferromagnetic (AF) in these simulations, whereas the cubic paramagnetic (PM) phase was treated by “carrying out a non-magnetic calculation without considering the spin degree of freedom in the system”1. In our view, it is incorrect to consider the cubic PM phase of CrN to be non-magnetic because the local magnetic moments on Cr atoms still exist above the N{\'{e}}el temperature. It is known that non-magnetic ab initio calculations show qualitatively different electronic structures with a large peak in electron density of states right at the Fermi level, in contrast to experimental measurements of the PM cubic phase, which show semiconductor behaviour2, 3, 4. The differences in structural properties between non-magnetic and magnetic calculations were also recently highlighted in refs 5 and 6.},

The method is used to study the phonon broadening in graphite and graphene mono- and bilayers. The broadening of the high-energy optical branches is highly nonuniform and presents a series of sudden steps and spikes. At finite temperature, the two linearly dispersive acoustic branches TA and LA of graphene have nonzero broadening for small wave vectors. The broadening in graphite and bilayer graphene is, overall, very similar to the graphene one, the most remarkable feature being the broadening of the quasiacoustical Z-polarized branch. Finally, we study the intrinsic anharmonic contribution to the thermal conductivity of the three systems, within the single mode relaxation time approximation. We find the conductance to be in good agreement with experiments in the out-of-plane direction but underestimate by a factor 2 in-plane.},

H5MD files are self-contained, and foster the reproducibility of scientific data and the interchange of data between researchers using different simulation programs and analysis software.

It was revealed that larger Si-rich clusters increase in number after prolonged NA. The long-term NA after PA is believed to promote the preferential aggregation of solute Si toward clusters formed during PA rather than the independent formation of Si-based clusters. The prolonged NA inhibits the hardness increase during bake-hardening (BH) treatment at 170°C. The deterioration of the BH response appears to be due to the increase of the Si-rich clusters.},

These are primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup under high-voltage cycling conditions, as well as the first-cycle coulombic inefficiency. It was found that the surface reconstruction exhibits a strong anisotropic characteristic, which predominantly occurs along lithium diffusion channels. Furthermore, the surface reaction layer is composed of lithium fluoride embedded in a complex organic matrix.

abstract = {We develop the embedded-atom method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1285 (1983)], based on density-functional theory, as a new means of calculating ground-state properties of realistic metal systems. We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using the embedding energy from which we obtain several ground-state properties, such as the lattice constant, elastic constants, sublimation energy, and vacancy-formation energy. We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100), (110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100), (110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture. We emphasize problems with hydrogen and with surfaces because none of these can be treated with pair potentials. The agreement with experiment, the applicability to practical problems, and the simplicity of the technique make it an effective tool for atomistic studies of defects in metals.},

@article{Stedman1967,
abstract = {The phonon-frequency distributions of aluminum and lead have been determined from individual frequencies measured by neutron spectrometry. The measurements were mainly for wave vectors in the symmetry directions, but were sufficient elsewhere to permit interpolation throughout a cell of the wave-vector space solely with the help of symmetry conditions. Since there is little latitude for subjectivity in this process, the resulting distributions may be regarded as experimentally determined. They differ appreciably from distributions obtained by Born-von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n analysis of dispersion curves. The distributions have been used to calculate heat capacities at temperatures up to 800° (A1) and 500°K (Pb), with corrections for anharmonicity based on shifts of phonon frequencies with temperature. Formulas for the anharmonic corrections are derived on the assumption of effectively independent modes, with small relative frequency shifts that vary with temperature in the same way as the vibrational energy of the lattice. One correction affects both Cp{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}p and Cv{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}v, but is actually very small. Another, which is more important, is approximately of the form aC2T{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}a{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}mi{\textgreater}T, where a{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}a is closely related to an average value of the rate at which phonon frequencies vary with temperature at the temperature concerned. When a{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}a corresponds to frequency shifts at constant pressure (observed), this gives the anharmonic contribution to Cp{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}p; the anharmonic contribution to Cv{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}v requires shifts at constant volume, which cannot be observed directly. Calculated and calorimetric values of Cp{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}p agree well in the range of temperature where the expression aC2T{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}a{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}mi{\textgreater}T is a fair approximation. The corresponding expression with the parameter appropriate to constant-volume changes is expected to be a good approximation over a wider range of temperature, and it has been evaluated by comparison of calculations and calorimetric results. For both aluminum and lead, the anharmonic contribution to Cv{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}C{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}v thus arrived at is some 10 times smaller than the theoretical estimates of Keller and Wallace, which were based on a Lennard-Jones interatomic potential. The quasiharmonic approximation used here gives a very good account of the heat capacity up to at least 500°K in Al and 400°K in Pb. No conclusion can be drawn about the variation of the electronic heat capacity with temperature, mainly because of uncertainty in the calorimetric data. It seems that the lattice heat capacity of aluminum should vary in an anomalous manner below 20°K, first falling below a T3{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}T{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}3 curve and then rising above it in the usual way; unfortunately, precise measurements that might reveal such behavior do not extend beyond 4°K.},

@article{VandeWalle1998,
abstract = {Experimental as well as theoretical work indicates that the relative stability of the ordered and the disordered states of a compound may be significantly affected by their difference in vibrational entropy. The origin of this difference is usually attributed to the fact that disordering reduces the number of stiff bonds between different atomic species in favor of soft bonds between identical atomic species. The results of previous theoretical investigations, however, suggest that this simple mechanism is significantly modified as a result of local atomic relaxations. To gain further insight regarding the importance of relaxations, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the magnitude of the vibrational entropy difference between the ordered and the disordered state of Pd3V. Our investigation reveals that bond stiffness changes due to relaxation entirely mask the large configurational dependence of vibrational entropy provided by bond stiffness differences. Our analysis also suggests a simple technique to estimate vibrational entropy based on the relationship between bond length and bond stiffness.},

We mimic the traditional solid-state approach to the investigation of vibrational spectra, i.e., we start from a suitably chosen reference configuration of the compound and describe its energy as a function of arbitrary atomic distortions by means of a Taylor series. Such a form of the potential-energy surface is general, trivial to formulate for any material, and physically transparent. Further, such models involve clear-cut approximations, their precision can be improved in a systematic fashion, and their simplicity allows for convenient and practical strategies to compute/fit the potential parameters. We illustrate our scheme with two challenging cases in which the model potential is strongly anharmonic, namely, the ferroic perovskite oxides PbTiO3 and SrTiO3. Studying these compounds allows us to better describe the connection between the so-called effective-Hamiltonian method and ours (which may be seen as an extension of the former), and to show the physical insight and predictive power provided by our approach-e.g., we present new results regarding the factors controlling phase-transition temperatures, novel phase transitions under elastic constraints, an improved treatment of thermal expansion, etc.},

abstract = {Materials with very low thermal conductivity are of great interest for both thermoelectric and optical phase-change applications. Synthetic nanostructuring is most promising for suppressing thermal conductivity through phonon scattering, but challenges remain in producing bulk samples. In crystalline AgSbTe2 we show that a spontaneously forming nanostructure leads to a suppression of thermal conductivity to a glass-like level. Our mapping of the phonon mean free paths provides a novel bottom-up microscopic account of thermal conductivity and also reveals intrinsic anisotropies associated with the nanostructure. Ground-state degeneracy in AgSbTe2 leads to the natural formation of nanoscale domains with different orderings on the cation sublattice, and correlated atomic displacements, which efficiently scatter phonons. This mechanism is general and suggests a new avenue for the nanoscale engineering of materials to achieve low thermal conductivities for efficient thermoelectric converters and phase-change memory devices.},

abstract = {The highest critical temperature of superconductivity Tc has been achieved in cuprates: 133 K at ambient pressure and 164 K at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable combination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and phonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds. Numerous followed calculations supported this idea and predicted Tc=100-235 K for many hydrides but only moderate Tc{\~{}}17 K has been observed experimentally. Here we found that sulfur hydride transforms at P{\~{}}90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc increasing with pressure to 150 K at {\~{}}200 GPa. This is in general agreement with recent calculations of Tc{\~{}}80 K for H2S. Moreover we found superconductivity with Tc{\~{}}190 K in a H2S sample pressurized to P{\textgreater}150 GPa at T{\textgreater}220 K. This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S, and formation of SHn (n{\textgreater}2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity by the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper resistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope shift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the superconductivity. H2S is a substance with a moderate content of hydrogen therefore high Tc can be expected in a wide range of hydrogen-contain materials. Hydrogen atoms seem to be essential to provide the high frequency modes in the phonon spectrum and the strong electron-phonon coupling.},

We find that the temperature dependence of the vacancy formation energy can make a significant wnlribution to the vacancy concen{\~{}}on at high temperatures. An additional goal of the present study is to evaluate the accuracy of the local harmonic method under circumstances in which the excess entropy associated with the fomation of a defect is very small. Ow data demonstrate that while the ermrs associated with determining the vacancy formation entropy in the local harmonic model are large, a simple extension to the local harmonic method yields thermodynamic properties mmparable to that obtained in the quasiharmonic model, but with much higher wmpurational efficiency.},

abstract = {We propose the neural programmer-interpreter (NPI): a recurrent and compositional neural network that learns to represent and execute programs. NPI has three learnable components: a task-agnostic recurrent core, a persistent key-value program memory, and domain-specific encoders that enable a single NPI to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases generalization ability compared to sequence-to-sequence LSTMs. The program memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input. Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn several types of compositional programs: addition, sorting, and canonicalizing 3D models. Furthermore, a single NPI learns to execute these programs and all 21 associated subprograms.},

The required incorporation of long-range interactions is achieved by combining the numerical accuracy of neural networks with an electrostatic term based on environment-dependent charges.

abstract = {Metals have been mankind's most essential materials for thousands of years; however, their use is affected by ecological and economical concerns. Alloys with higher strength and ductility could alleviate some of these concerns by reducing weight and improving energy efficiency. However, most metallurgical mechanisms for increasing strength lead to ductility loss, an effect referred to as the strength-ductility trade-off. Here we present a metastability-engineering strategy in which we design nanostructured, bulk high-entropy alloys with multiple compositionally equivalent high-entropy phases. High-entropy alloys were originally proposed to benefit from phase stabilization through entropy maximization. Yet here, motivated by recent work that relaxes the strict restrictions on high-entropy alloy compositions by demonstrating the weakness of this connection, the concept is overturned. We decrease phase stability to achieve two key benefits: interface hardening due to a dual-phase microstructure (resulting from reduced thermal stability of the high-temperature phase); and transformation-induced hardening (resulting from the reduced mechanical stability of the room-temperature phase). This combines the best of two worlds: extensive hardening due to the decreased phase stability known from advanced steels and massive solid-solution strengthening of high-entropy alloys. In our transformation-induced plasticity-assisted, dual-phase high-entropy alloy (TRIP-DP-HEA), these two contributions lead respectively to enhanced trans-grain and inter-grain slip resistance, and hence, increased strength. Moreover, the increased strain hardening capacity that is enabled by dislocation hardening of the stable phase and transformation-induced hardening of the metastable phase produces increased ductility. This combined increase in strength and ductility distinguishes the TRIP-DP-HEA alloy from other recently developed structural materials. This metastability-engineering strategy should thus usefully guide design in the near-infinite compositional space of high-entropy alloys.},

Schwarzites are a class of three-dimensional fully covalent sp(2)-bonded carbon polymorphs, with the same local chemical environment as graphene and carbon nanotubes, but negative Gaussian curvature. We calculate the thermal conductivity of a (10,0) carbon nanotube, graphene and two schwarzites with different curvature, by molecular dynamics simulations based on the Tersoff empirical potential. We find that schwarzites present a thermal conductivity two orders of magnitude smaller than nanotubes and graphene. The reason for such large difference is explained by anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations, which show that phonon group velocities and mean free paths are much smaller in schwarzites than in nanotubes and graphene. Their reduced thermal conductivity, in addition to tunable electronic properties, indicate that schwarzites could pave the way towards all-carbon thermoelectric technology with high conversion efficiency.},

@article{Cheng2018,
abstract = {We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}-iron, taking account of the quantum fluctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30{\%} of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.},

@article{DeFontaine1988,
abstract = {In the late sixties, it was recognized that the omega phase transformation occurring in bcc Ti, Zr, and Hf alloys was a displacive transition which could be described, at least qualitatively, by simple models. Since the displacive wave responsible for the transition to perfect omega was a Brillouin zone boundary wave, displacements and volume changes were rather small, in contrast to the classical martensite case. The nonideal, or modulated omega phase requires further consideration, and calls for soliton models, for example. Recent first principles electronic structure calculations, briefly reported upon here, have also shed light on the athermal omega transformation.},

abstract = {We report first-principles calculations of the phonon dispersion spectrum, thermal expansion, and heat capacity of uranium dioxide. The so-called direct method, based on the quasiharmonic approximation, is used to calculate the phonon frequencies within a density functional framework for the electronic structure. The phonon dispersions calculated at the theoretical equilibrium volume agree well with experimental dispersions. The computed phonon density of states (DOSs) compare reasonably well with measured data, as do also the calculated frequencies of the Raman and infrared active modes including the LO/TO splitting. To study the pressure dependence of the phonon frequencies we calculate phonon dispersions for several lattice constants. Our computed phonon spectra demonstrate the opening of a gap between the optical and acoustic modes induced by pressure. Taking into account the phonon contribution to the total free energy of UO 2 its thermal expansion coefficient and heat capacity have been computed from first-principles. Both quantities are in good agreement with available experimental data for temperatures up to about 500 K. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ShengBTE is a software package for computing the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline bulk materials and nanowires with diffusive boundary conditions. It is based on a full iterative solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. Its main inputs are sets of second- and third-order interatomic force constants, which can be calculated using third-party ab-initio packages. Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free. The code is free software, written in Fortran and parallelized using MPI. A complementary Python script to help compute third-order interatomic force constants from a minimum number of ab-initio calculations, using a real-space finite-difference approach, is also publicly available for download. Here we discuss the design and implementation of both pieces of software and present results for three example systems: Si, InAs and lonsdaleite.

Our principle aim is to explain and to reconcile, with examples, the perspectives on this problem that are often strikingly different between exponents of CALPHAD, and others working in the overlapping fields of physics, chemistry and materials science. Current methodologies described here include the compound energy formalism of CALPHAD, besides the rather different but related canonical and grand-canonical formalisms. We show how the calculation of appropriate defect formation energies should be formulated, how they are included in the different formalisms and in turn how these yield equilibrium defect concentrations and their contribution to free energies and chemical potentials. Furthermore, we briefly review the current state-of-the-art and challenges in determining point defect properties from first-principles calculations as well as from experimental measurements.},

abstract = {Using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Phase Field Crystal (PFC) modelling, the early-stage precipitation phenomenon is investigated for naturally- and artificially-aged Al-Mg-Si alloys of two different Mg/Si ratios, i.e. 1 and 2. It is shown that, regardless of alloy composition and aging history, the earliest precipitates appear as finely-dispersed Si-rich clusters which gradually undergo a simultaneous coarsening and Mg-enrichment. In addition, the energetic factors for the instability of natural aging clusters are analysed. The energy analysis also suggests that the initial Si-enrichment of the earliest precipitates is due to the affinity of locally-strained areas for higher Si concentrations when achieving a meta-stable equilibrium with the strain-free surrounding matrix. The subsequent Mg-enrichment is shown to be energetically necessary for an evolving precipitate to survive and grow. The alloy with smaller Mg/Si ratio shows a delay in the onset of Mg-enrichment during natural aging, which is attributed to the higher average Si content, as well as the slow kinetics of diffusion at natural aging temperatures. It is shown that this alloy exhibits a smaller nucleation barrier and critical nucleus size as well. We suggest that the above described mechanisms govern the evolution of early-stage clustering in the common range of age-hardenable Al-Mg-Si alloy compositions.},

abstract = {We propose a machine-learning method for evaluating the potential barrier governing atomic transport based on the preferential selection of dominant points for the atomic transport. The proposed method generates numerous random samples of the entire potential energy surface (PES) from a probabilistic Gaussian process model of the PES, which enables defining the likelihood of the dominant points. The robustness and efficiency of the method are demonstrated on a dozen model cases for proton diffusion in oxides, in comparison with a conventional nudge elastic band method.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread use of silicon in modern technology, its peculiar thermal expansion is not well-understood. Adapting harmonic phonons to the specific volume at temperature, the quasiharmonic approximation, has become accepted for simulating the thermal expansion, but has given ambiguous interpretations for microscopic mechanisms. To test atomistic mechanisms, we performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments from 100-1500K on a single-crystal of silicon to measure the changes in phonon frequencies. Our state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, which fully account for phonon anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, reproduced the measured shifts of individual phonons with temperature, whereas quasiharmonic shifts were mostly of the wrong sign. Surprisingly, the accepted quasiharmonic model was found to predict the thermal expansion owing to a fortuitous cancellation of contributions from individual phonons.},

In addition to the underlying approximations of ab-initio parameterization, two main challenges are associated with this path: high computational costs and lack of automation in the frameworks using this methodology, which affect the discovery rate of novel materials with ad-hoc properties. Here, the Automatic Anharmonic Phonon Library (AAPL) is presented. It efficiently computes interatomic force constants by making effective use of crystal symmetry analysis, it solves the Boltzmann transport equation to obtain

                , and allows a fully integrated operation with minimum user intervention, a rational addition to the current high-throughput accelerated materials development framework AFLOW. An “experiment vs. theory” study of the approach is shown, comparing accuracy and speed with respect to other available packages, and for materials characterized by strong electron localization and correlation. Combining AAPL with the pseudo-hybrid functional ACBN0 is possible to improve accuracy without increasing computational requirements. A new theoretical framework could provide a more efficient method for calculating a material's thermal conductivity. Understanding how materials conduct heat is crucial for a range of applications, from heat sinks to thermal insulation. Despite its fundamental importance, predicting a material's lattice thermal conductivity is challenging, and often requires experimental data or knowledge of specific properties to be entered during the process. An international team of researchers led by Stefano Curtarolo from Duke University now present a framework that can predict the lattice thermal conductivity of single-crystal and polycrystalline materials using just a single input file, with no further intervention. Called the Automatic Anharmonic Phonon Library, the methods computes certain parameters using symmetry analysis, before solving the Boltzmann transport equation, providing information on both the electronic structure and phonon-dependent properties.},

The method is verified by studying the intrinsic strong higher-order anharmonic effects in UO 2 and CeO 2 . Comparison of the thermal conductivity results, which calculated by the anharmonic lattice dynamics method coupled with the Boltzmann transport equation and the spectral energy density method coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulation further validates our analysis. Analysis of the bulk Si and Ge systems confirms that the fourth-order phonon anharmonicity is enhanced and cannot be neglected at high enough temperatures, which agrees with a previous study where the four-phonon scattering was explicitly determined. This metric will facilitate evaluating and interpreting the lattice thermal conductivity of crystals with strong fourth-order phonon anharmonicity.},

abstract = {The interactions between electrons and lattice vibrations are fundamental to materials behaviour. In the case of group IV-VI, V and related materials, these interactions are strong, and the materials exist near electronic and structural phase transitions. The prototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been recently associated with large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Here we show that it is primarily electron-phonon coupling involving electron states near the band edges that leads to the ferroelectric instability in PbTe. Using a combination of nonequilibrium lattice dynamics measurements and first principles calculations, we find that photoexcitation reduces the Peierls-like electronic instability and reinforces the paraelectric state. This weakens the long-range forces along the cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and low lattice thermal conductivity. Our results demonstrate how free-electron-laser-based ultrafast X-ray scattering can be utilized to shed light on the microscopic mechanisms that determine materials properties.},

abstract = {The space of metastable materials offers promising new design opportunities for next-generation technological materials such as complex oxides, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steels, and beyond. Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic understanding of their underlying ther- modynamics exists. We report a large-scale data-mining study of the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of density functional theory–calculated energetics of Inorganic Crystal Structure Database structures, to explicitly quantify the thermodynamic scale of metastability for 29,902 observed inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible thermodynamic range of crystalline meta- stability for polymorphic and phase-separating compounds, yielding new physical insights that can guide the design of novel metastable materials. We further assert that not all low-energy metastable compounds can necessarily be synthesized, and propose a principle of ‘remnant metastability'—that observable metastable crystalline phases are generally remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase.},

@phdthesis{Glensk2015b,
abstract = {Computer simulations are becoming increasingly important to develop and optimize materials. Highly accurate quantum mechanical approaches such as density-functional theory (DFT) have been originally designed to predict T=0K properties only. Finite temperature atomic vibrations are often treated approximatively and the extension to fully anharmonic vibrations is presently one of the major challenges in DFT. This thesis presents efficient tools to take these contributions into account. Based on a wide range of assessed materials we developed the Local Anharmonic (LA) approximation and the Local Gr{\"{u}}neisen Theory (LGT), which consider anharmonic correlations of atomic vibrations and are able to describe energies of defects and bulk systems to unprecedented accuracy. It is shown that the so far not accessible ab initio calculated anharmonic excitations are as dominant to bulk thermodynamics as the generally considered quasiharmonic corrections. For defect properties even qualitative effects are found due to anharmonicity. The developed physical picture of the origin of phonon-phonon interactions opens the path toward a routine assessment of highly accurate material properties over the whole temperature range.},

It is revealed that the negative third-order term of the L-L expansion drives the transition and works, in competition with the second-harmonic term, to form the modulated omega phase; moreover, it functions to maintain soliton walls with constant width against temperature changes. The modulated omega phase is elucidated to have a microstructure with the sequence of subvariants-omega 1-omega 3-omega 2-separated by soliton walls of anti-omega structure. A series of primitive activation units of the modulated omega phase, which can be depicted in a phase diagram, is obtained in the Zr-20 wt{\%} Nb-alloy system by analyzing the L-L free-energy function with the appropriate numerical calculations.},

abstract = {The study of many-body physics has provided a scientific playground of surprise and continuing revolution over the past half century. The serendipitous discovery of new states and properties of matter, phenomena such as superfluidity, the Meissner, the Kondo and the fractional quantum hall effects, have driven the development of new conceptual frameworks for our understanding about collective behavior, the ramifications of which have spread far beyond the confines of terres-trial condensed matter physics-to cosmology, nuclear and particle physics. Here I shall selectively review some of the developments in this field, from the cold-war period, until the present day. I describe how, with the discovery of new classes of collective order, the unfolding puzzles of high temperature superconductivity and quantum criticality, the prospects for major conceptual discoveries remain as bright today as they were more than half a century ago. 1 Emergent Matter: a new Frontier Since the time of the Greeks, scholars have pondered over the principles that govern the universe on its tiniest and most vast scales. The icons that exemplify these frontiers are very well known -the swirling galaxy denoting the cosmos and the massive accelerators used to probe matter at successively smaller scales-from the atom down to the quark and beyond. These traditional frontiers of physics are largely concerned with reductionism: the notion that once we know the laws of nature that operate on the smallest possible scales, the mysteries of the universe will finally be revealed to us[1]. Over the last century and a half, a period that stretches back to Darwin and Boltzmann-scientists have also become fascinated by another notion: the idea that to understand nature, one also needs to understand and study the princi-ples that govern collective behavior of vast assemblies of matter. For a wide range of purposes, we already know the microscopic laws that govern matter on the tiniest scales. For example, a gold atom can be completely understood with the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation and the laws of quantum mechanics established more than seventy years ago. Yet, a gold atom is spherical and featureless-quite unlike the lustrous malleable and conducting metal which human society so prizes. To under-stand how crystalline assemblies of gold atoms acquire the properties of metallic gold, we need new principles– principles that describe the collective behavior of matter when humungous numbers of gold atoms congregate to form a metallic crystal. It is the search for these new principles that defines the frontiers of many-body physics in the realms of condensed matter physics and its closely related},

abstract = {High-throughput computational materials searches generate large databases of locally-stable structures. Conventionally, the needle-in-a-haystack search for the few experimentally-synthesizable compounds is performed using a convex hull construction, which identifies structures stabilized by manipulation of a particular thermodynamic constraint (for example pressure or composition) chosen based on prior experimental evidence or intuition. To address the biased nature of this procedure we introduce a generalized convex hull framework. Convex hulls are constructed on data-driven principal coordinates, which represent the full structural diversity of the database. Their coupling to experimentally-realizable constraints hints at the conditions that are most likely to stabilize a given configuration. The probabilistic nature of our framework also addresses the uncertainty stemming from the use of approximate models during database construction, and eliminates redundant structures. The remaining small set of candidates that have a high probability of being synthesizable provide a much needed starting point for the determination of viable synthetic pathways.},

The formalism is applied for the $\beta$-phase vanadium monohydride. The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are used to prepare the sample data set from which the MLP for the vanadium monohydride (VH) system is constructed. In the molecular dynamics simulation with the MLP, the time-averaged structure of $\beta$−VH is predicted correctly to be the body-centered tetragonal structure with the octahedral (O) site occupation of H. The average lattice constants are in good agreement with the experimental data which are not able to be reproduced by the static DFT calculation. The O-site occupation of H observed in the average structure is, however, a saddle point on the potential-energy surface, and the actual hydrogen occupation is found to be the 4T configuration.},

abstract = {This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

There is a marked difference between the coupling of the vibrational state to the valence band maximum and to the conduction band minimum. The strength of phonon coupling to the valence band maximum is similar between the three systems and is dominated by vibrations that change the bond length. The coupling strength to the conduction band minimum differs significantly in diamond, silicon carbide, and silicon. In diamond, the coupling is dominated by six small pockets of vibrational states in the phonon Brillouin zone that are ultimately responsible for the stronger electron-phonon coupling in this material. Our results represent a first step towards the development of an a priori understanding of electron-phonon coupling in semiconductors and insulators that should aid the design of materials with tailored electron-phonon coupling properties.},

@book{Allen2001,
abstract = {Amazon.com With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, "flow," "mind like water," and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance. Not quite. Yes, Getting Things Done offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists-all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible Fast Company has dubbed "the personal productivity guru," suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.) As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket" That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). -Timothy Murphy},

@article{Imbalzano2018,
abstract = {Machine learning of atomic-scale properties is revolutionizing molecular modelling, making it possible to evaluate inter-atomic potentials with first-principles accuracy, at a fraction of the costs. The accuracy, speed and reliability of machine-learning potentials, however, depends strongly on the way atomic configurations are represented, i.e. the choice of descriptors used as input for the machine learning method. The raw Cartesian coordinates are typically transformed in "fingerprints", or "symmetry functions", that are designed to encode, in addition to the structure, important properties of the potential-energy surface like its invariances with respect to rotation, translation and permutation of like atoms. Here we discuss automatic protocols to select a number of fingerprints out of a large pool of candidates, based on the correlations that are intrinsic to the training data. This procedure can greatly simplify the construction of neural network potentials that strike the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, and has the potential to accelerate by orders of magnitude the evaluation of Gaussian Approximation Potentials based on the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions kernel. We present applications to the construction of neural network potentials for water and for an Al-Mg-Si alloy, and to the prediction of the formation energies of small organic molecules using Gaussian process regression.},

abstract = {The characterization of native point defects in ZnO is still a question of debate. For example, experimental evidence for ZnO with an excess of Zn is inconclusive as to whether the dominant defects are metal interstitials or oxygen vacancies. This information is essential to understand the behavior of the material and to tailor its numerous technological applications. We use the first-principles pseudopotential method to determine the electronic structure, atomic geometry, and formation energy of native point defects in ZnO. Interstitials, vacancies, and antisites in their relevant charge states are considered and the effects of dopants are also discussed. The results show that both the Zn and O vacancies are the relevant defects in ZnO. We also propose a possible transition mechanism and defect center responsible for the experimentally observed green luminescence.},

abstract = {Lattice anharmonicity is thought to strongly affect vacancy concentrations in metals at high temperatures. It is however non-trivial to account for this effect directly using density functional theory (DFT). Here we develop a deep neural network potential for aluminum that overcomes the limitations inherent to DFT, and we use it to obtain accurate anharmonic vacancy formation free energies as a function of temperature. While confirming the important role of anharmonicity at high temperatures, the calculation unveils a markedly nonlinear behavior of the vacancy formation entropy and shows that the vacancy formation free energy only violates Arrhenius law at temperatures above 600 K, in contrast with previous DFT calculations.},

A multiphase composite average yielded a mantle Rayleigh number adequate to promote the vigorous thermal convection of the mantle that is expected geophysically.},

abstract = {Time-resolved infrared absorption spectroscopy of the local vibrational modes (LVMs) of light impurities in crystalline silicon reveal that the vibrational lifetimes of almost identical LVMs sometimes differ by up to two orders of magnitude. Indeed, at low temperatures, the lifetimes of the 2062cm-1 mode of H2*, the 1998cm-1 mode of H+ BC, and the 2072cm-1 mode of V2 H2 are 4,8, and 295ps, respectively. Since the optical phonon of Si is about 530cm-1, these decays should all involve at least four phonons and have long and comparable lifetimes. More surprising still, the measured lifetime of the asymmetric stretch of interstitial O in Si changes by almost an order of magnitude with the isotope of O or one of its Si neighbors. In this work, ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations in periodic supercells are used to calculate the temperature dependence of vibrational lifetimes. The theoretical approach developed for these calculations can be applied to the calculation of any vibrational lifetime in any crystal. The calculations predict accurate lifetimes of the various defects in the range 50{\textless}T{\textless}200K and provide critical insight into the decay processes.},

The effect of Ga doping on the thermoelectric properties has also been investigated by measurements of thermopower, electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient and thermal conductivity in temperature range from 300 to 850K. All samples exhibit a p-type conductivity evidenced by positive sign of both thermopower and Hall coefficient in the investigated temperatures. The maximum value of the dimensionless figure of merit ZT was reached for the Mg2Si0.6Ge0.4:Ga(0.8{\%}) compound at 625K (ZT∼0.36). The p-type character of thermoelectric behaviours of Ga-doped Mg2Si and Mg2Si0.6Ge0.4 compounds well corroborates with the results of electronic structure calculations performed by the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker method and the coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA), since Ga diluted in Mg2Si and Mg2Si0.6Ge0.4 (on Si/Ge site) behaves as hole donor due to the Fermi level shifted to the valence band edge. The onset of large peak of DOS from Ga impurity at the valence band edge, well corroborates with high Seebeck coefficient measured in Ga-doped samples.},

The present measurements were extended to energies in the micro-eV range, and showed significant, but smaller, enhancements in the number of modes in the energy range from 5 to 18 microeV. These modes of micro-eV energies provide a long-wavelength limit that bounds the fraction of modes at milli-eV energies originating with the cooperative dynamics of the nanocrystalline microstructure.},

These experimentally- derived quantities are valuable to benchmark first-principles theoretical predictions of harmonic and non-harmonic thermal behaviors using perturbation theory, ab initio molecular-dynamics, or Monte-Carlo simulations. We illustrate this analysis by computing the harmonic, dilational, and anharmonic contributions to the entropy, internal energy, and free energy of elemental aluminum and the ordered compound FeSi over a wide range of temperature. Results agree well with previous data in the literature and provide an efficient approach to estimate anharmonic effects in materials.},

abstract = {Heat capacities have been measured for Al(n-1)Cu(-) clusters (n=49-62) and compared with results for pure Al(n) (+) clusters. Al(n-1)Cu(-) and Al(n) (+) have the same number of atoms and the same number of valence electrons (excluding the copper d electrons). Both clusters show peaks in their heat capacities that can be attributed to melting transitions; however, substitution of an aluminum atom by a copper atom causes significant changes in the melting behavior. The sharp drop in the melting temperature that occurs between n=55 and 56 for pure aluminum clusters does not occur for the Al(n-1)Cu(-) analogs. First-principles density-functional theory has been used to locate the global minimum energy structures of the doped clusters. The results show that the copper atom substitutes for an interior aluminum atom, preferably one with a local face-centered-cubic environment. Substitution does not substantially change the electronic or geometric structures of the host cluster unless there are several Al(n) (+) isomers close to the ground state. The main structural effect is a contraction of the bond lengths around the copper impurity, which induces both a contraction of the whole cluster and a stress redistribution between the Al-Al bonds. The size dependence of the substitution energy is correlated with the change in the latent heat of melting on substitution.},

abstract = {The effect of anharmonic corrections to the vibrational energies of extended systems is explored. Particular attention is paid to the thermodynamics of adsorption of small molecules on catalytically relevant systems typically affected by anharmonicity. The implemented scheme obtains one-dimensional anharmonic model potentials by distorting the equilibrium structure along the normal modes using both rectilinear (Cartesian) or curvilinear (internal) representations. Only in the latter case, the modes are decoupled also at higher order of the potential and the thermodynamic functions change in the expected directions. The method is applied to calculate ab initio enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies for the adsorption of methane in acidic chabazite (H–CHA) and on MgO(001) surface. The values obtained for the adsorption of methane in H–CHA (273.15 K, 0.1 MPa, $\theta$ = 0.5) are $\Delta$H = −19.3, −T$\Delta$S = 11.9, and $\Delta$G = −7.5 kJ/mol.

First it is applied to a large dataset composed of the cohesive energy for about 18000 compounds computed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As a result, we obtain a kernel ridge prediction model with a prediction error of 0.041 eV/atom, which is close to the "chemical accuracy" of 1 kcal/mol (0.043 eV/atom). The procedure is also applied to two smaller datasets, i.e., a dataset of the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) for 110 compounds computed by DFT calculation and a dataset of the experimental melting temperature for 248 compounds. We examine the performance of the descriptor sets on the efficiency of Bayesian optimization in addition to the accuracy of the kernel ridge regression models. They exhibit good predictive performances.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies of phase stability in solid materials with dynamic disorder are challenging due to the failure of the standard picture of atoms vibrating around fixed equilibrium positions. Dynamically disordered solid materials show immense potential in applications. In particular, superionic conductors, where the disorder results in exceptionally high ionic conductivity, are very promising as solid state electrolytes in batteries and fuel cells. The biggest obstacle in living up to this potential is the limited stability of the dynamically disordered phases. Here, we outline a method to obtain the free energy of a dynamically disordered solid. It is based on a stress-strain thermodynamic integration on a deformation path between a mechanically stable ordered variant of the disordered phase, and the dynamically disordered phase itself. We show that the large entropy contribution associated with the dynamic disorder is captured in the behavior of the stress along the deformation path. We apply the method to Bi2O3, whose superionic $\delta$ phase is the fastest known solid oxide ion conductor. We accurately reproduce the experimental transition enthalpy and the critical temperature of the phase transition from the low temperature ground state $\alpha$ phase to the superionic $\delta$ phase. The method can be used for a first-principles description of the phase stability of superionic conductors and other materials with dynamic disorder, when the disordered phase can be connected to a stable phase through a continuous deformation path.},

abstract = {We theoretically evaluate the thermoelectric trans- port coefficients of hybrid thiophene/SiGe superlattices and the effect of their chemical tuning via phenyl groups. Owing to the interplay between alloy scattering and phonon transmission at the molecular layers, very low thermal conductivities under 1 W/(m K) and values of ZT more than twice as large as those of bulk SiGe can be attained. These results highlight exciting possibilities of organic−inorganic hybrid systems, as compared to traditional inorganic thermoelectrics.},

abstract = {Inelastic neutron scattering was used to measure the phonon density of states in fcc palladium and platinum metal at temperatures from 7 K to 1576 K. Both phonon-phonon interactions and electron-phonon interactions were calculated by methods based on density functional theory (DFT) and were consistent with the measured shifts and broadenings of phonons with temperature. Unlike the longitudinal modes, the characteristic transverse modes had a nonlinear dependence on temperature owing to the requirement for a population of thermal phonons for upscattering. Kohn anomalies were observed in the measurements at low temperature and were reproduced by calculations based on DFT. Contributions to the entropy from phonons and electrons were assessed and summed to obtain excellent agreement with prior calorimetric data. The entropy from thermal expansion is positive for both phonons and electrons but larger for phonons. The anharmonic phonon entropy is negative in Pt, but in Pd it changes from positive to negative with increasing temperature. Owing to the position of the Fermi level on the electronic DOS, the electronic entropy was sensitive to the adiabatic electron-phonon interaction in both Pd and Pt. The adiabatic EPI depended strongly on thermal atom displacements.},

The resulting unfolded band structures contain additional rich information from the Kohn-Sham orbitals, and absorb the structure factor that makes them ideal for a direct comparison with angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. With negligible computational expense via the use of Wannier functions, this simple method has great practical value in the studies of a wide range of materials containing impurities, vacancies, lattice distortions, or spontaneous long-range orders.},

@article{Daw1993,
abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

abstract = {The so-called platinum metals are Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt. Our workgroup has already published data on Pd, Ir and Pt. The present work will focus on measurements of the thermophysical properties of rhodium, which have been carried out recently. The scarce literature data available emphasize the need for new measurements. Using a rapid pulse-heating technique, wire-shaped specimens are ohmic-heated by the passage of a large current pulse. This fast heating drives the sample from room temperature up into the liquid phase in typically 50 µs and thus prevents chemical reactions and gravitational distortions. Enthalpy, electrical resistivity and volume expansion can be obtained as a function of temperature. From these results, heat of fusion, heat capacity and change of density can be calculated as a function of temperature. A set of data of the mentioned quantities will be presented and the comparison to literature values will be discussed within this study. Additionally we will contrast the results for rhodium with the respective results for Pd, Ir and Pt. The conformity of data published decades ago with our new measurements is fairly high. Rhodium does not show unexpected behaviour regarding the comparison to Pd, Ir and Pt.},

@phdthesis{Werinos2012,
abstract = {Al-Mg-Si (6xxx-series) alloys belong to the industrially most important age-hardenable aluminium alloys. Due to hardening during natural aging, which commences instantly after quenching, the aluminium industry cannot guarantee its customers consistent forming properties of quenched sheets. Nevertheless, delivery in a naturally aged state is necessary, especially as the claim for an excellent forming behavior exists. Formability would be significantly worse in an artificially aged, stable state. An important technical aim of this project therefore is to stabilize the quenched state of 6xxx alloys as long as possible at a low strength level or to maximally slow down the initial hardness increase. Besides negatively influencing stability properties, natural aging also shows a rather adverse effect on subsequent artificial aging. For sheet material used in the automotive industry this is of major disadvantage as not only the attainable strength level, but also age hardening kinetics during artificial aging are reduced. Thus the hardness increase as well as achievable strength values during paint baking of automobile bodies for 30 minutes, are strongly restricted. For slab material the physical process of natural aging is relevant because after few hours the hardening potential during artificial aging is reduced. On the one hand the aim now is energy saving due to shorter artificial aging periods (slab material) because of the increased artificial aging kinetics while avoiding age-hardening during room temperature storage. On the other hand improved properties with regard to maximum strength (sheet and slab material) are aspired. In cooperation with the AMAG Austria Metall AG, the aforementioned objectives are intended to be achieved with the help of marginal changes in the alloy composition (addition of microalloying elements) while at the same time optimizing individual artificial aging steps. It is presumed, that the gained knowledge can be extended to other alloy classes.},

abstract = {Close-packed chalcogenide spinels, such as MgSc2Se4, MgIn2S4 and MgSc2S4, show potential as solid electrolytes in Mg batteries, but are affected by non-negligible electronic conductivity, which contributes to self-discharge when used in an electrochemical storage device. Using first-principles calculations, we evaluate the energy of point defects as function of synthesis conditions and Fermi level to identify the origins of the undesired electronic conductivity. Our results suggest that Mg-vacancies and Mg-metal antisites (where Mg is exchanged with Sc or In) are the dominant point defects that can occur in the systems under consideration. While we find anion-excess conditions and slow cooling to likely create conditions for low electronic conductivity, the spinels are likely to exhibit significant n-type conductivity under anion-poor environments, which are often present during high temperature synthesis. Finally, we explore extrinsic aliovalent doping to potentially mitigate the electronic conductivity in these chalcogenide spinels. The computational strategy is general and can be easily extended to other solid electrolytes (and electrodes) to aid in the optimization of the electronic properties of the corresponding frameworks.},

abstract = {The density matrix renormalization (DMRG) group method for ladders works much more efficiently with open boundary conditions. One consequence of these boundary conditions is ground-state charge density oscillations that often appear to be nearly constant in magnitude or to decay only slightly away from the boundaries. We analyze these using bosonization techniques, relating their detailed form to the correlation exponent and distinguishing boundary induced generalized Friedel oscillations from true charge density waves. We also discuss a different approach to extracting the correlation exponent from the finite size spectrum which uses exclusively open boundary conditions and can therefore take advantage of data for much larger system sizes. A general discussion of the Friedel oscillation wave vectors is given, and a convenient Fourier transform technique is used to determine it. DMRG results are analyzed on Hubbard and t-J chains and 2 leg t-J ladders. We present evidence for the existence of a long-ranged charge density wave state in the t-J ladder at a filling of n = 0.75 and near J/t ≈ 0.25.},

We show that the fourth- and third-order contributions, respectively, enhance and lower the conductivity, which can be understood by a strengthening or weakening of the stiffness of the bonds in the system. On comparing the heat conductivity in percolating and compositionally disordered systems, we find that disorder loosening the structure (percolating systems) favors the effect of anharmonicity.},

The interplanar-force constants for three high-symmetry orientations [(100), (110), and (111)] are evaluated by supercell calculations using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. By considering the symmetry of the crystal, three-dimensional interatomic-force-constant matrices are determined by a least-squares fit. Interactions up to the eighth nearest neighbors are included. The dynamical matrix, which is the Fourier transform of the force constant matrix, is hence constructed and diagonalized for any arbitrary wave vector in the Brillouin zone, yielding the phonon dispersion. In this paper we will present the calculation details and discuss various aspects of convergence. Phonon dispersions of Si and Ge calculated are in excellent agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {Hydrogen sulfides have recently received a great deal of interest due to the record high superconducting temperatures of up to 203 K observed on strong compression of dihydrogen sulfide (H2S). A joint theoretical and experimental study is presented in which decomposition products and structures of compressed H2S are characterized, and their superconducting properties are calculated. In addition to the experimentally known H2S and H3S phases, our first-principles structure searches have identified several energetically competitive stoichiometries that have not been reported previously; H2S3, H3S2, and H4S3. In particular, H4S3 is predicted to be thermodynamically stable within a large pressure range of 25-113 GPa. High-pressure room-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements confirm the presence of H3S and H4S3 through decomposition of H2S that emerge at 27 GPa and coexist with residual H2S, at least up to the highest pressure studied in our experiments of 140 GPa. Electron-phonon coupling calculations show that H4S3 has a small Tc of below 2 K, and that H2S is mainly responsible for the observed superconductivity of samples prepared at low temperature ({\textless}100K).},

abstract = {A method to measure the phonon dispersion of a crystal based on molecular dynamics simulation is proposed and implemented as an extension to an open source classical molecular dynamics simulation code LAMMPS. In the proposed method, the dynamical matrix is constructed by observing the displacements of atoms during molecular dynamics simulation, making use of the fluctuation-dissipation theory. The dynamical matrix can then be employed to compute the phonon spectra by evaluating its eigenvalues. It is found that the proposed method is capable of yielding the phonon dispersion accurately, while taking into account the anharmonic effect on phonons simultaneously. The implementation is done in the style of fix of LAMMPS, which is designed to run in parallel and to exploit the functions provided by LAMMPS; the measured dynamical matrices could be passed to an auxiliary postprocessing code to evaluate the phonons.

The quantum of such lattice vibration is called the phonon, and the so-called "lattice dynamics" is the field of study to find the normal modes of these vibrations. In other words, lattice dynamics examines the relationship between the frequencies of phonons and the wave vectors, i.e., the phonon dispersion. The evaluation of the phonon dispersion requires the construction of the dynamical matrix. In atomic scale modeling, the dynamical matrices are usually constructed by deriving the derivatives of the force field employed, which cannot account for the effect of temperature on phonons, with an exception of the tedious "quasi- harmonic" procedure. Solution method: We propose here a method to construct the dynamical matrix directly from molecular dynamics simulations, simply by observing the displacements of atoms in the system thus making the constructing of the dynamical matrix a straightforward task. Moreover, the anharmonic effect was taken into account in molecular dynamics simulations naturally, the resultant phonons therefore reflect the finite temperature effect simultaneously. Restrictions: A well defined lattice is necessary to employ the proposed method as well as the implemented code to evaluate the phonon dispersion. In other words, the system under study should be in solid state where atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions. Besides, no drifting of the lattice is expected. The method is best suited for periodic systems, although non-periodic system with a supercell approach is also possible, it will however become inefficient when the unit cell contains too many atoms. Additional comments: The readers are encouraged to visit http://code.google.com/ p/fix-phonon for subsequent update of the code as well as the associated postprocessing code, so as to keep up with the latest version of LAMMPS. Running time: Running time depends on the system size, the numbers of processors used, and the complexity of the force field, like a typical molecular dynamics simulation. For the third example shown in this paper, it took about 2.5 hours on an Intel Xeon X3220 architecture (2.4G, quadcore). References: C. Campa????, M.H. M??ser, Phys. Rev. B 74 (2006) 075420.L.T.

The solid is produced industrially at high chemical purities by deposition from a vapor phase, and oxygen may be included at this stage. Oxidation represents a potential path for tuning its properties without introducing more exotic elements or extreme processing conditions. In this work, ab initio computational methods are used to examine the energy potentials and electronic properties of different extents of oxidation in GaN. Solid-state vibrational properties of Ga, GaN, Ga2O3, and a single substitutional oxygen defect have been studied using the harmonic approximation with supercells. A thermodynamic model is outlined which combines the results of ab initio calculations with data from experimental literature. This model allows free energies to be predicted for arbitrary reaction conditions within a wide process envelope. It is shown that complete oxidation is favorable for all industrially relevant conditions, while the formation of defects can be opposed by the use of high temperatures and a high N2:O2 ratio.},

@article{Kapil2016,
abstract = {The development and implementation of increasingly accurate methods for electronic structure calculations mean that, for many atomistic simulation problems, treating light nuclei as classical particles is now one of the most serious approximations. Even though recent developments have significantly reduced the overhead for modelling the quantum nature of the nuclei, the cost is still prohibitive when combined with advanced electronic structure methods. Here we present how multiple time step integrators can be combined with ring-polymer contraction techniques (effectively, multiple time stepping in imaginary time) to reduce virtually to zero the overhead of modelling nuclear quantum effects, while describing inter-atomic forces at high levels of electronic structure theory. This is demonstrated for a combination of MP2 and semi-local DFT applied to the Zundel cation. The approach can be seamlessly combined with other methods to reduce the computational cost of path integral calculations, such as high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator, or generalized Langevin equation thermostats.},

abstract = {The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.},

@article{Tadano2014,
abstract = {A systematic method to calculate anharmonic force constants of crystals is presented. The method employs the direct-method approach, where anharmonic force constants are extracted from the trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate cubic and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements. The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then, combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the whole method to a thermoelectric material Mg2Si and demonstrate the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with low thermal conductivities.},

@article{Fultz2010,
abstract = {The literature on vibrational thermodynamics of materials is reviewed. The emphasis is on metals and alloys, especially on the progress over the last decade in understanding differences in the vibrational entropy of different alloy phases and phase transformations. Some results on carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydrides and lithium-storage materials are also covered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPrinciples of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of vibrational entropy with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic X-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in vibrational entropy of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the vibrational entropy of mixing in solid solutions, compound formation from pure elements, chemical unmixing of alloys, order–disorder transformations, and martensitic transformations. Systematic trends are available for some of these phase transformations, although more examples are needed, and many results are less reliable at high temperatures. Nanostructures in materials can alter sufficiently the vibrational dynamics to affect thermodynamic stability. Internal stresses in polycrystals of anisotropic materials also contribute to the heat capacity. Lanthanides and actinides show a complex interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic entropy, even at low temperatures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nA “quasiharmonic model” is often used to extend the systematics of harmonic phonons to high temperatures by accounting for the effects of thermal expansion against a bulk modulus. Non-harmonic effects beyond the quasiharmonic approximation originate from the interactions of thermally-excited phonons with other phonons, or with the interactions of phonons with electronic excitations. In the classical high temperature limit, the adiabatic electron–phonon coupling can have a surprisingly large effect in metals when temperature causes significant changes in the electron density near the Fermi level. There are useful similarities in how temperature, pressure, and composition alter the conduction electron screening and the interatomic force constants. Phonon–phonon “anharmonic” interactions arise from those non-harmonic parts of the interatomic potential that cannot be accounted for by the quasiharmonic model. Anharmonic shifts in phonon frequency with temperature can be substantial, but trends are not well understood. Anharmonic phonon damping does show systematic trends, however, at least for fcc metals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTrends of vibrational entropy are often justified with atomic properties such as atomic size, electronegativity, electron-to-atom ratio, and mass. Since vibrational entropy originates at the level of electrons in solids, such rules of thumb prove no better than similar rules devised for trends in bonding and structure, and tend to be worse. Fortunately, the required tools for accurate experimental investigations of vibrational entropy have improved dramatically over the past few years, and the required ab initio methods have become more accessible. Steady progress is expected for understanding the phenomena reviewed here, as investigations are performed with the new tools of experiment and theory, sometimes in integrated ways.},

abstract = {The natural aging behavior of pure ternary Al-Mg-Si alloys is investigated by measuring hardness, electrical resistivity and positron lifetime, as well as carrying out thermal analysis and atom probe microscopy. It is found that several distinct temporal stages of natural aging can be distinguished in which one of these quantities shows a characteristic behavior and that these times coincide for many of these measurements. The rate of change in the measured data is correlated with proposed solute dynamics during natural aging for both aging that takes place prior to artificial aging (natural pre-aging) and after artificial underaging (natural secondary aging) heat treatments. Controlling factors for solute dynamics are discussed.},

@article{Toher2017,
abstract = {Thorough characterization of the thermo-mechanical properties of materials requires difficult and time-consuming experiments. This severely limits the availability of data and it is one of the main obstacles for the development of effective accelerated materials design strategies. The rapid screening of new potential systems requires highly integrated, sophisticated and robust computational approaches. We tackled the challenge by surveying more than 3,000 crystalline solids within the AFLOW framework with the newly developed "Automatic Elasticity Library" combined with the previously implemented GIBBS method. The first extracts the mechanical properties from automatic self-consistent stress-strain calculations, while the latter employs those mechanical properties to evaluate the thermodynamics within the Debye model. The new thermo-elastic library is benchmarked against a set of 74 experimentally characterized systems to pinpoint a robust computational methodology for the evaluation of bulk and shear moduli, Poisson ratios, Debye temperatures, Gr$\backslash$"uneisen parameters, and thermal conductivities of a wide variety of materials. The effect of different choices of equations of state is examined and the optimum combination of properties for the Leibfried-Schl$\backslash$"omann prediction of thermal conductivity is identified, leading to improved agreement with experimental results than the GIBBS-only approach.},

It is found that for potentials with similar range with the Lennard-Jones potential at the minimum, due to the difference at the short and long ranges, the favorite structures can be very different, and some previously unknown magic numbers are located.},

@article{Morris1992,
abstract = {We examine an extension of self-consistent phonon theory (SCPT) that allows for the explicit evaluation of second-order corrections to the free energy for both the high- and low-temperature phases for a system undergoing a first-order structural phase transition. The motivation for the inclusion of these terms stemmed from the many-body theory developed to treat the lattice vibrations in anharmonic crystals. This approach does not modify predictions for the phonon frequencies that would be observed by inelastic neutron scattering; however, we show that these higher-order contributions to the free energy are essential if the bulk limit of the equilibrium thermodynamic quantities are to be forecast accurately. Finite-size scaling is used to extrapolate the bulk limit, and we present arguments showing that precursor fluctuations are not allowed in bulk systems that are truly ergodic. Thus, in part the effectiveness of our second-order SCPT may be understood by noting the absence of large-amplitude fluctuations. In addition, dynamical structure factors, calculated using molecular-dynamic simulations, for systems of a strip geometry, show sharp phonon peaks at the SCPT frequencies, with lifetimes much longer than phonon periods-these lifetimes grow as one approaches the bulk limit. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

Heat conduction has been studied for over two hundred years, yet many of the microscopic details have remained unknown in most crystalline solids, including which phonon-phonon interactions are primarily responsible for thermal resistance and how heat is distributed among the broad thermal spectrum. This lack of knowledge was the result of limitations on the available tools to study heat conduction. However, recent advances in both computation and experiment are enabling an unprecedented microscopic view of thermal transport by phonons in both bulk and nanostructured crystals, from the level of atomic bonding to mesoscopic transport in complex devices. In this topical review, we examine these techniques and the microscopic insights gained into the science and engineering of heat conduction.},

@article{Zhang2011,
abstract = {A recent report of highly unusual ferroelectric fluctuations in PbTe by E. S. Bo{\v{z}}in et al. [ Science 330 1660 (2010)] raises fundamental questions about the nature of underlying lattice dynamics. We show by first-principles calculations that the reported results can be attributed to abnormally large-amplitude thermal vibrations that stem from a delicate competition of dual ionicity and covalency, which puts PbTe near ferroelectric instability. It produces anomalous properties such as partially localized low-frequency phonon modes, a soft transverse optical phonon mode, and a positive temperature coefficient for the band gap. These results account for experimental findings and resolve the underlying atomistic mechanisms, which have broad implications for materials near dynamic instabilities.},

@article{Macleod1972,
abstract = {Enthalpies of pure platinum and of a platinum + 10 mass per cent rhodium alloy have been measured in the range 400 to 1700 K by adiabatic drop calorimetry. The results for platinum are represented by the equation.With a mean deviation of ±0.3 per cent. At high temperatures the results are in excellent agreement with the published values of Jaeger and co-workers but at low temperatures there is a significant discrepancy between the two sets; an explanation for this discrepancy is proposed in terms of an error in Jaeger's method of calibrating his calorimeter. The molar thermodynamic properties of platinum have been calculated from 300 to 2000 K and the values obtained are regarded as being more reliable than those of previous tabulations. The enthalpy difference between the solid solution Pt0.826Rh0.174 and the corresponding amounts of the pure metals has been calculated at each experimental temperature in the range 400 to 1700 K. A positive deviation of about 50 calth mol−1 from the Neumann-Kopp rule is indicated but discordant results at the higher temperatures suggest the necessity for a re-determination of the high-temperature thermodynamic properties of rhodium.},

abstract = {An angular-dependent interatomic potential has been developed for the Al-Cu system based on existing embedded-atom method potentials for Al and Cu and fitting of the cross-interaction functions to experimental and first-principles data. The potential reproduces lattice parameters, formation energies, and elastic constants of the $\theta$ and $\theta$′ phases of this system. It predicts the $\theta$′ phase to be more stable than $\theta$ at 0 K but to become less stable at hight temperatures due to vibrational entropy. The temperate and entropy of this phase transformation are in good agreement with previous first-principles calculations. The potential provides a reasonable description of the phase stability across the Al-Cu phase diagram, dilute heats of solution, and other thermodynamic properties. It has also been tested for generalized stacking fault energies in the presence of a copper layer embedded in Al. This configuration bears some resemblance to Guinier-Preston zones that strengthen Al-Cu alloys. The trends predicted by the potential for uniform shearing of this configuration are in agreement with results of first-principles density-functional calculations performed in this work. The potential is expected to be suitable for atomistic simulations of precipitation hardening of Al-Cu alloys. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

We describe the system using a lattice-gas Hamiltonian, determined from density functional theory, together with Monte Carlo (MC) calculations.

From calculation of the (configurational) density of states by the recently introduced Wang-Landau MC algorithm, we derive thermodynamic quantities, such as the free energy and entropy, which are not directly accessible from conventional MC simulations. We accurately reproduce the stoichiometry, as well as the temperature at which an order-disorder phase transition occurs, and demonstrate the crucial role, and magnitude, of the configurational entropy.},

The compounds studied were TaBe12, Ta2Be17, Hf2Be21, MoSi2, TaSi2, and WSi2. An investigation of the rates of oxidation of intermetallic beryllides was initiated. The oxidation of TaBe12, Hf2Be21, ZrBe13, and Ta2Be17 in the range 2300 to 2750 F was found to obey an exponential rate law which was cubic or a higher power rate law. In most cases, the cubic rate law applied. The products of the oxidation of ZrBe13 at 2500 F were identified as Zr2Be17 and BeO. Tentative activation energies for a cubic rate process were calculated for TaBe12 and Hf2Be21.},

Our new experimental results illustrate how this method can yield good agreement with experiment when realistic composition profiles are used as inputs for the theoretical model. Due to intrinsic limitations to the InAs thickness than can be grown, bulk-like SLs show limited sensitivity to the details of their composition profile, but the situation changes significantly when finite-thickness effects are considered. If In segregation could be minimized during the growth process, SLs with significantly higher {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} than that of the random alloy with the same composition would be obtained, with the potential to improve heat dissipation in InAs/GaAs-based devices.},

It is demonstrated that the entropy effect arising from the freedom of local atomic displacements drives the thermal expansion.

@article{Esfarjani2011,
abstract = {Using harmonic and anharmonic force constants extracted from density functional calculations within a supercell, we have developed a relatively simple but general method to compute thermodynamic and thermal properties of any crystal. First, from the harmonic, cubic, and quartic force constants, we construct a force field for molecular dynamics. It is exact in the limit of small atomic displacements and thus does not suffer from inaccuracies inherent in semiempirical potentials such as Stillinger-Weber's. By using the Green-Kubo formula and molecular dynamics simulations, we extract the bulk thermal conductivity. This method is accurate at high temperatureswhere three-phonon processes need to be included to higher orders, butmay suffer from size scaling issues. Next, we use perturbation theory (Fermi golden rule) to extract the phonon lifetimes and compute the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ from the relaxation-time approximation. This method is valid at most temperatures, but will overestimate $\kappa$ at very high temperatures, where higher-order processes neglected in our calculations also contribute. As a test, these methods are applied to bulk crystalline silicon, and the results are compared and differences are discussed in more detail. The presented methodology paves the way for a systematic approach to model heat transport in solids using multiscale modeling, in which the relaxation time due to anharmonic three-phonon processes is calculated quantitatively, in addition to the usual harmonic properties such as phonon frequencies and group velocities. It also allows the construction of an accurate bulk interatomic potentials database.},

abstract = {An analysis of thermal conductivity is presented which differs from that of Klemens and of Callaway in that it considers explicitly the conduction by both transverse and longitudinal phonons. This approach is then used to provide a very good fit to the data on silicon from 1.7 to 1300°K and on germanium from 1.7 to 1000°K, and is also used to fit the data on isotropically pure germanium. A comparison of the analysis with that due to Callaway shows that the same results are obtained in the impurity scattering and boundary scattering regions. A discussion of the approximations used in the various analyses is included. A more complete expression for the umklapp scattering relaxation time, valid for materials with a very disperse transverse acoustic phonon spectrum, is derived in an appendix. The question of the validity of the addition of inverse relaxation times and the coupling due to normal three-phonon processes is considered in another appendix.},

@article{Hua2017,
abstract = {Interfaces play an essential role in phonon-mediated heat conduction in solids, impacting applications ranging from thermoelectric waste heat recovery to heat dissipation in electronics. From the microscopic perspective, interfacial phonon transport is described by transmission coefficients that link vibrational modes in the materials composing the interface. However, direct experimental determination of these coefficients is challenging because most experiments provide a mode-averaged interface conductance that obscures the microscopic detail. Here, we report a metrology to extract thermal phonon transmission coefficients at solid interfaces using ab-initio phonon transport modeling and a thermal characterization technique, time-domain thermoreflectance. In combination with transmission electron microscopy characterization of the interface, our approach allows us to link the atomic structure of an interface to the spectral content of the heat crossing it. Our work provides a useful perspective on the microscopic processes governing interfacial heat conduction.},

The results of free energy calculation by these methods are compared with each other in a wide temperature range, and their applicability is discussed. As a tool we use classical molecular dynamics modeling on the example of bcc molybdenum and fcc aluminum. The relation is observed between how the vibrational spectrum changes with temperature due to the anharmonicity of the potential and how free energy is reproduced. All methods are consistent with each other within 10 meV/at. at relatively low temperatures. At high temperatures, the discrepancy reaches tens of meV/at., although the relative error is less than 5{\%}.},

@article{Miracle2017,
abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are barely 12 years old. The field has stimulated new ideas and has inspired the exploration of the vast composition space offered by multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Here we present a critical review of this field, with the intent of summarizing key findings, uncovering major trends and providing guidance for future efforts. Major themes in this assessment include definition of terms; thermodynamic analysis of complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs); taxonomy of current alloy families; microstructures; mechanical properties; potential applications; and future efforts. Based on detailed analyses, the following major results emerge. Although classical thermodynamic concepts are unchanged, trends in MPEAs can be different than in simpler alloys. Common thermodynamic perceptions can be misleading and new trends are described. From a strong focus on 3d transition metal alloys, there are now seven distinct CCA families. A new theme of designing alloy families by selecting elements to achieve a specific, intended purpose is starting to emerge. A comprehensive microstructural assessment is performed using three datasets: experimental data drawn from 408 different alloys and two computational datasets generated using the CALculated PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method. Each dataset emphasizes different elements and shows different microstructural trends. Trends in these three datasets are all predicted by a ‘structure in – structure out' (SISO) analysis developed here that uses the weighted fractions of the constituent element crystal structures in each dataset. A total of 13 distinct multi-principal element single-phase fields are found in this microstructural assessment. Relationships between composition, microstructure and properties are established for 3d transition metal MPEAs, including the roles of Al, Cr and Cu. Critical evaluation shows that commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys with 3 or more principal elements are MPEAs, as well as some established functional materials. Mechanical properties of 3d transition metal CCAs are equivalent to commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys, while some refractory metal CCAs show potential to extend the service strength and/or temperature of nickel superalloys. Detailed analyses of microstructures and properties allow two major HEA hypotheses to be resolved. Although the ‘entropy effect' is not supported by the present data, it has nevertheless made an enduring contribution by inspiring a clearer understanding of the importance of configurational entropy on phase stability. The ‘sluggish diffusion' hypothesis is also not supported by available data, but it motivates re-evaluation of a classical concept of metallic diffusion. Building on recent published work, the CCA field has expanded to include materials with metallic, ionic or covalent bonding. It also includes microstructures with any number of phases and any type of phases. Finally, the MPEA field is shown to include both structural and functional materials applications. A significant number of future efforts are recommended, with an emphasis on developing high-throughput experiments and computations for structural materials. The review concludes with a brief description of major accomplishments of the field and insights gained from the first 12 years of research. The field has lost none of its potency and continues to pose new questions and offer new possibilities. The vast range of complex compositions and microstructures remains the most compelling motivation for future studies.},

abstract = {The density matrix renormalization (DMRG) group method for ladders works much more efficiently with open boundary conditions. One consequence of these boundary conditions is ground-state charge density oscillations that often appear to be nearly constant in magnitude or to decay only slightly away from the boundaries. We analyze these using bosonization techniques, relating their detailed form to the correlation exponent and distinguishing boundary induced generalized Friedel oscillations from true charge density waves. We also discuss a different approach to extracting the correlation exponent from the finite size spectrum which uses exclusively open boundary conditions and can therefore take advantage of data for much larger system sizes. A general discussion of the Friedel oscillation wave vectors is given, and a convenient Fourier transform technique is used to determine it. DMRG results are analyzed on Hubbard and t-J chains and 2 leg t-J ladders. We present evidence for the existence of a long-ranged charge density wave state in the t-J ladder at a filling of n = 0.75 and near J/t ≈ 0.25.},

abstract = {In computer simulations, quantum delocalization of atomic nuclei can be modeled making use of the Path Integral (PI) formulation of quantum statistical mechanics. This approach, however, comes with a large computational cost. By restricting the PI modeling to a small region of space, this cost can be significantly reduced. In the present work we derive a Hamiltonian formulation for a bottom-up, theoretically solid simulation protocol that allows molecules to change their resolution from quantum-mechanical to classical and vice versa on the fly, while freely diffusing across the system. This approach renders possible simulations of quantum systems at constant chemical potential. The validity of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by means of simulations of low temperature parahydrogen. Potential future applications include simulations of biomolecules, membranes, and interfaces.},

This unprecedented behavior without an associated static structural distortion probably originates from the strong dynamic coupling between acoustic phonons and low-energy spin fluctuations in geometrically frustrated magnets. The replacement of magnetic Ho for Y at the ferroelectrically active site results in an even larger effect, suggestive of the strong influence of multiferroicity.},

abstract = {The diffusion coefficients of several transition elements (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and a few non-transition elements (Mg, Si, Ga, and Ge) in fcc and liquid Al are critically reviewed and assessed by means of the least-squares method and semi-empirical correlations. Inconsistent experimental data are identified and ruled out. In the case of the elements, for which plentiful experimental data are available in the literature, the least-squares analysis gives rise to the activation energies and pre-exponential factors in an Arrhenius equation. For the elements with limited experimental data or no data at all, the diffusion parameters are estimated from two semi-empirical correlations. In one correlation, the logarithmic pre-exponential factors are plotted against the activation energies for various elements in Al. In the other correlation, the activation energies are shown as a function of valences relative to Al. The diffusion coefficients calculated by using the evaluated diffusion parameters agree reasonably with the reliable experimental data. The proposed semi-empirical correlations are used to predict the diffusion coefficients of a few elements in liquid Al. A satisfactory agreement between the predicted and measured diffusion coefficients is obtained. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Urban2016,
abstract = {Over the last two decades, computational methods have made tremendous advances, and today many key properties of lithium-ion batteries can be accurately predicted by first principles calculations. For this reason, computations have become a cornerstone of battery-related research by providing insight into fundamental processes that are not otherwise accessible, such as ionic diffusion mechanisms and electronic structure effects, as well as a quantitative comparison with experimental results. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ab initio approaches for the modelling of battery materials. We consider techniques for the computation of equilibrium cell voltages, 0-Kelvin and finite-temperature voltage profiles, ionic mobility and thermal and electrolyte stability. The strengths and weaknesses of different electronic structure methods, such as DFT+U and hybrid functionals, are discussed in the context of voltage and phase diagram predictions, and we review the merits of lattice models for the evaluation of finite-temperature thermodynamics and kinetics. With such a complete set of methods at hand, first principles calculations of ordered, crystalline solids, i.e., of most electrode materials and solid electrolytes, have become reliable and quantitative. However, the description of molecular materials and disordered or amorphous phases remains an important challenge. We highlight recent exciting progress in this area, especially regarding the modelling of organic electrolytes and solid–electrolyte interfaces.},

We present a theoretical investigation of the possibility of crystalline and coherent ( 001) interfaces that satisfies the two necessary criteria, stability with respect to lattice vibrations as well as to variations in stoichiometry. It is found that one monolayer of Si tetrahedrally coordinated by N in a B3-like geometry embedded between B1-TiN( 001) surfaces is both dynamically stable and thermodynamically stable with respect to vacancy formation. However, with increasing layer thickness the B3-type structure becomes unstable with respect to Si vacancy formation. Instead we suggest that a tetragonal D0(22)-like order of Si vacancies can stabilize the interface. These structures are in line with the experimental findings of the crystalline tissue phase which has coherent interfaces with TiN.},

The strength of the thin film is not significantly decreased down to a thickness of less than 1 nm. Surprisingly, there is also no considerable effect of the surface reconstruction. This suggests that the lower stresses found for surface crack nucleation in an experiment are due to substantial flaws and not an intrinsic effect of the ideal surface. The band gap energy of the thin film is lower than that of the bulk, but a band gap remains up to high strain in the thin film. DOI:},

In the cases when displacements of atoms from their equilibrium positions are not large, the proposed method has a similar accuracy as the state-of-the-art cluster expansion method, and a better accuracy when the fitting dataset size is small. The proposed model has only two tunable parameters—one for the interaction range and one for the interaction complexity.},

abstract = {Using the ab initio method within the local-density approximation with ultrasoft pseudopotentials and plane-wave basis; calculating the Hellmann-Feynman forces and applying the direct method; the phonon-dispersion relations for ferroelectric and paraelectric rhombohedral phases of LiNbO3 crystal have been derived. The calculated phonon frequencies for the ferroelectric phase at the $\Gamma$ point are compared with Raman; infrared; and neutron-scattering measurements; and they agree very well. The phonon frequencies at the Z; L; and F high-symmetry points are also calculated. It is disclosed that the force constants involving lithium ions are an order of magnitude smaller than the force constants between niobium and oxygen ions. As a consequence; the lithium ions do not contribute to high-frequency optical vibrations. In the paraelectric phase the phonon-dispersion curves show a soft branch with the soft mode of symmetry A2u at the $\Gamma$ point. This soft mode leads to the observed paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition. The LO/TO splitting is considered by assuming formal values of ionic charges; and by fitting the longitudinal infrared active modes to the experimental data.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity in dielectric crystals is the result of the non-equilibrium relaxation of lattice vibrations described by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. An exact microscopic definition of the heat carriers and their relaxation times is still missing: phonons, typically regarded as the relevant excitations for thermal transport, cannot be identified as the heat carriers when most scattering events conserve momentum and do not dissipate heat. This is the case for two-dimensional or layered materials at room temperature, or three-dimensional crystals at cryogenic temperature. In this work we show first that the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix in the Boltzmann equation define collective phonon excitations, termed here relaxons. These excitations have well defined relaxation times directly related to heat dissipation, and provide an exact description of thermal transport as a kinetic theory of the relaxon gas. We show why Matthiessen's rule is typically violated, and construct a procedure for obtaining the mean free paths and relaxation times of the relaxons. Such considerations, while general, are of the utmost importance in the case of two-dimensional materials and revise by several orders of magnitude the time-scales (and, in part, the length-scales) for thermal transport.},

By utilizing invariant points in the feature space at which the atomic energy has a fixed reference value, we examine the atomic energy mapping of neural network potentials. Through a series of examples on Si, we demonstrate that the neural network potential is vulnerable to 'ad hoc' mapping in which the total energy appears to be trained accurately while the atomic energy mapping is incorrect in spite of its capability. We show that the energy mapping can be improved by choosing the training set carefully and monitoring the atomic energy at the invariant points during the training procedure.},

The underlying mechanism is explained in terms of the effective size-independent thermal gradient and the match/mismatch of the phonon bands. We also show the robustness of the thermal diode upon variation of the model's parameters. Our finding suggests a promising way for designing realistic efficient thermal diodes.},

abstract = {The dynamical and thermodynamic phase stabilities of the stoichiometric compound CrN including different structural and magnetic configurations are comprehensively investigated using a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) plus U (DFT + U) approach in conjunction with experimental measurements of the thermal expansion. Comparing DFT and DFT + U results with experimental data reveals that the treatment of electron correlations using methods beyond standard DFT is crucial. The nonmagnetic face-centered cubic B1-CrN phase is both elastically and dynamically unstable, even under high pressure, while CrN phases with nonzero local magnetic moments are predicted to be dynamically stable within the framework of the DFT + U scheme. Furthermore, the impact of different treatments for the exchange-correlation (xc)-functional is investigated by carrying out all computations employing the local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation. To address finite-temperature properties, both magnetic and vibrational contributions to the free energy have been computed employing our recently developed spin-space averaging method. The calculated phase transition temperature between low-temperature antiferromagnetic and high-temperature paramagnetic (PM) CrN variants is in excellent agreementwith experimental values and reveals the strong impact of the choice of the xc-functional. The temperature-dependent linear thermal expansion coefficient of CrN is experimentally determined by the wafer curvature method from a reactive magnetron sputter deposited single-phase B1-CrN thin film with dense film morphology. A good agreement is found between experimental and ab initio calculated linear thermal expansion coefficients of PM B1-CrN. Other thermodynamic properties, such as the specific heat capacity, have been computed as well and compared to previous experimental data.},

The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that can be used to perform machine-learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous electrical response of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.},

Especially these phonons, but also all other phonons, soften considerably with increasing temperature. Comparing thermodynamic properties of the fcc and the two bcc phases it is shown that the high-temperature bcc phase is stabilized predominantly by vibrational entropy, whereas for the stabilization of the fcc phase electronic entropy provides an equal contribution.},

@article{Castin2014,
abstract = {We propose a methodology for predicting migration energies associated to the migration of single atoms towards vacant sites, using artificial neural networks. The novelty of the approach, which has already been proven efficient for bulk materials (e.g. bcc or fcc Fe-based alloys), is to allow for any structure, without restriction to a specific lattice. The proposed technique is designed in conjunction with a novel kind of lattice-free atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo model. The idea is to avoid as much as possible heavy atomistic simulations, e.g. static relaxation or general methods for finding transition paths. Such calculations, however, are applied once per Monte Carlo event, when a selected event is applied. The objective of this work is thus to propose a methodology for defining migration events at every step of the simulation, and at the same time assigning a frequency of occurrence to them (using artificial neural networks), in short computing times. We demonstrate the feasibility of this new concept by designing neural networks for predicting vacancy migration energies near grain boundaries in bcc FeCr alloys. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very effectively as a tool to manipulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic ensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar, exquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical properties computed from thermostatted trajectories. By developing quantitative measures of the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we show that these analytical results accurately predict the behavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and could help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of thermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum nuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some of the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of results for the modelling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids and solids.},
